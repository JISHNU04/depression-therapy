4,"<start> chronically depressed years i feel pathetic , but am finding small victories in my daily routine lately . <end>","<start> it is nice when people give us compliments . we have to learn to love ourselves . do things we love , meet new people , wake up early get a workout in . do not watch any negative news , get your mind in grateful state and attack the day . something about the first few hours of the day that are the quietest and most rewarding <end>"
5,<start> sick of being sad and lonely <end>,"<start> dude , i am terribly sorry for how things have happened and i can not even fathom how much it must hurt to have had it constantly in your face . but for now , there is the positive that you will no longer have to face it daily . and believe me , as soon as something is out of sight , it slowly but surely gets out of your mind . i can only assume that you are feeling the weight of the expectations you had for your senior year crushing you when you compare it to what actually happened , but still . experiences never quite live up to expectations . as for the decision you made about this girl , you can only take it as experience . i will not say things happen for a reason but i will say that you should not beat yourself up for the decision you made at the time . it was done upon what you thought you knew about her , and in the end you did it to protect yourself , which is not inherently wrong . the way i look at it , is that you would have never known that it was wrong until you did it . and that means you only can do better in the future . and hey , working out and having a business in high school are no small feat , specially taking in account everything that was running through your head at the same time . believe me . for now at least you can say that if another girl like her comes along , you will not let yourself wall up , and actually try , even if it ends up hurting . you are going to do great things kid . and it is more than ok to feel depressed , especially after everything has come and gone and you can actually look back on it , but do not do anything rash . in life there are only two things that are a definite , death and change . so i really hope you await the next wave of change . godspeed , and trust in change . <end>"

21,"<start> i keep wishing something would happen that would put me in the hospital , which is stupid , but i can not help the thoughts <end>","<start> hi first , i am sorry you feel this way . the type of loneliness that comes from feeling unnoticed or not cared for by your friends and family is so painful . it is so important to feel wanted as human beings , that when we do not get that feeling , we can go to some real dark places . i would say that it is not unhealthy to think the way you are describing it is actually probably a sign that you are brain is functioning , socially , at a normal level , because it understands that it is missing something in the relationships you have . it sounds like a pretty reasonable coping mechanism , to me . what is not healthy is that you do not feel validated or cared for in your relationships . that one is harder to address , for you and for someone over the internet . you deserve friends who care about you and listen to you , and you deserve to feel fulfilled by your relationships with others . if the people around you can not do that for you , i would say those are not not healthy friendships , and perhaps taking steps to find better relationships would be a good place to start i know easier said than done . if the fantasies stem from a desire for people to care about you , but you feel unnerved by the content , you could try to imagine scenarios in which you do good things for your friends that make them pay attention , such as saving them from a speeding car or taking care of them while they are sick . i do not know if that would help , but it might be an interesting thing to try . bottom line is that i do not think there is anything wrong with you , besides some friends who seem not to treat you right . i hope you find some genuine friends , the kind you deserve , and in the mean time , i hope you do not beat yourself up too bad about your brain s coping mechanisms . it is allyl good edit if there is any chance of you seeing a professional counselor , therapist , whoever , please take it it can potentially change your life in a really good way . <end>"

143,"<start> hey , a little advice about the drug use . do not attempt to quit when you are this fragile . i am an addict months clean today whoop whoop and spent years thinking if i just got clean , my mental health would improve . i had it the wrong way around , the addiction was just a symptom of my mental health being out of whack . the addiction was not the actual problem , so me trying to attack it was futile . the problem was that i was so desperate to escape my mentally unwell mind , that i would happily ruin my life for a temporary escape . be kind to yourself with your drug use , for now at least . recognize that you are trying to hide from pain and that there is nothing wrong with wanting to hide from pain . just start looking at healthier ways to address it , without beating yourself up when you get high . most of what kept me in the addiction loop was the shame guilt worthlessness that i would get when i failed yet again . do not get stuck in that loop , you are allowed to have weaknesses have you been tested for bipolar i only ask as hypersexuality and drug use are massive red flags . i was misdiagnosed with depression until very recently . the diagnosis never felt fully correct to me . not saying you have hypersexuality , but you seem to have done things that do not line up with your moral code character and that is a big indicator . you also talk about rock bottom , which can be easily obsessed over if you have had manic highs the contrast seems more in your face . also , sorry to say but you probably have not hit rock bottom . i would say i have not either , we are just too young . the thing is , your life might be going brilliant then bam depression comes and sucks the life from you . rock bottom could be when you should be the happiest . my worst depression so far came at a time when every aspect of my life was exactly how i would always dreamed . but every part of my being wanted to die . fucked up right . then i have had times where i should be in my darkest hour , but had some weird strength and resilience keeps me going . do not worry about whether this is rock bottom , worry about what you can learn to use for the next onslaught . knowledge is power after all <end>","<start> thanks for your input , it is greatly appreciated . i have too questioned whether it is just mad or bipolar disorder . i always rule out being bipolar because i take so many uppers coke and add pretty regularly , and usually when i display signs if mania . i have not been sober for so long that i honestly can not decipher the difference . i have been to multiple psychiatrist and therapist , i figured they would have diagnosed me properly . but maybe not . i have done a lot of research on both disorders . because google and self diagnosis are the way to go obviously . low i never considered that maybe i am experiencing episodes of mania , which then lead to me being hypersexual and doing drugs . thanks for putting that into perspective . since being in ok i have checked myself into a psych hospital once and attempted to start back on ability and veleta . but unfortunately since doing coke i stopped taking my meds . i completely agree that deciding to coke is a direct result of my mental health being out of whack . i realize that i enjoy the temporary feelings of euphoria and happiness . i know that i will not stop doing it until i get on some sort of meds to even out this chemical imbalance and remove myself from having access to it until i safely go through withdrawal . which is why i considered checking back into a hospital for a couple of weeks . thank you for the reminder to go easy on myself when it comes to doing it . but as you know it is a never ending cycle of beating myself up for doing it and rationalizing that it is okay it is just the depression causing it low . i hate that the only time i feel okay is while in high on uppers . i almost went to the point of trying to get prescribed add . thank god i did not . as far as rock bottom , i agree to a point . i say i hit rock bottom because i reached the point of getting addicted to meth . that for me i probably the worst thing i have ever done . i was on it for about three weeks . it was the best high i have ever experienced next to dot i only stopped because i started experiencing psychosis with body tremors . which lead my dumb ass to go to the dr only to be completely embarrassed and judged and told that it is normal just wait it out . i was treated like any other junky which was a really shitty feeling . i see why people do not reach out for help . anyways , since that incident i have touched it again but i secretly want to . i have been neglecting my financial responsibilities to buy coke and add . i understand why you would disagree that this is rock bottom but to me it is . the moment i decided to do meth and the after aftermath were rock bottom to me . the only thing i have going for me is the fact that i have an apartment and in employed . but does that really count if i am not paying my rent and i am having panic attacks at work that are causing me to leave . thank god my managers are understanding but i should not have a job rn . shame on me for going to work so fucking high that i became overly paranoid that everyone knew i was high which caused the panic attack . i just do not wtv i am doing with my life . i am literally wasting it . again , i know that it is due to this chemical imbalance but i can not refrain from taking some of the blame as just pure recklessness . ink . i clearly need to contact a psychiatrist as soon as possible and get properly diagnosed and on medication . it is just really hard not having a vehicle , getting around to the places i need to go to get shit done . none wants to ask for a ride to the local mental facility . but i want to get help because bi fear that this nonchalant whatever happens happens attitude will lead me to do something stupid . sorry for the long

dealing with also . <end>"
144,"<start> thanks for your input , it is greatly appreciated . i have too questioned whether it is just mad or bipolar disorder . i always rule out being bipolar because i take so many uppers coke and add pretty regularly , and usually when i display signs if mania . i have not been sober for so long that i honestly can not decipher the difference . i have been to multiple psychiatrist and therapist , i figured they would have diagnosed me properly . but maybe not . i have done a lot of research on both disorders . because google and self diagnosis are the way to go obviously . low i never considered that maybe i am experiencing episodes of mania , which then lead to me being hypersexual and doing drugs . thanks for putting that into perspective . since being in ok i have checked myself into a psych hospital once and attempted to start back on ability and veleta . but unfortunately since doing coke i stopped taking my meds . i completely agree that deciding to coke is a direct result of my mental health being out of whack . i realize that i enjoy the temporary feelings of euphoria and happiness . i know that i will not stop doing it until i get on some sort of meds to even out this chemical imbalance and remove myself from having access to it until i safely go through withdrawal . which is why i considered checking back into a hospital for a couple of weeks . thank you for the reminder to go easy on myself when it comes to doing it . but as you know it is a never ending cycle of beating myself up for doing it and rationalizing that it is okay it is just the depression causing it low . i hate that the only time i feel okay is while in high on uppers . i almost went to the point of trying to get prescribed add . thank god i did not . as far as rock bottom , i agree to a point . i say i hit rock bottom because i reached the point of getting addicted to meth . that for me i probably the worst thing i have ever done . i was on it for about three weeks . it was the best high i have ever experienced next to dot i only stopped because i started experiencing psychosis with body tremors . which lead my dumb ass to go to the dr only to be completely embarrassed and judged and told that it is normal just wait it out . i was treated like any other junky which was a really shitty feeling . i see why people do not reach out for help . anyways , since that incident i have touched it again but i secretly want to . i have been neglecting my financial responsibilities to buy coke and add . i understand why you would disagree that this is rock bottom but to me it is . the moment i decided to do meth and the after aftermath were rock bottom to me . the only thing i have going for me is the fact that i have an apartment and in employed . but does that really count if i am not paying my rent and i am having panic attacks at work that are causing me to leave . thank god my managers are understanding but i should not have a job rn . shame on me for going to work so fucking high that i became overly paranoid that everyone knew i was high which caused the panic attack . i just do not wtv i am doing with my life . i am literally wasting it . again , i know that it is due to this chemical imbalance but i can not refrain from taking some of the blame as just pure recklessness . ink . i clearly need to contact a psychiatrist as soon as possible and get properly diagnosed and on medication . it is just really hard not having a vehicle , getting around to the places i need to go to get shit done . none wants to ask for a ride to the local mental facility . but i want to get help because bi fear that this nonchalant whatever happens happens attitude will lead me to do something stupid . sorry for the long post . i am rambling thanks to add . i appreciate you whoever you are for listening to me vent and letting me know i am not alone . means more than you know . i wish you well with everything you are dealing with also . <end>","<start> do you get on couture much there is a guy there named cg kid and he helped me so much in putting my drug use into perspective . his personality and non judge vibe is a fucking breath of fresh air too i am not sure if he still does it , but he used to offer text counselling coaching to people . may help i missed the part about you doing meth initially . be careful with that drug , it is the devil in disguise as your best friend . you will eventually get used to being so high , that real life will bore the fuck out of you . your brain chemistry will take a massive beating too . i am not judging you though , i think anyone in the right circumstances would get hooked on it . since you are in the early phase , watch cg kids take on meth , he will change your mind as he will tell you where it leads . not just how good it feels at the beginning i think i initially came off as dismissive about you hitting rock bottom , sorry . i more meant that you have only lived like of your life , so statistically it could still happen . i got caught up in the idea of rock bottom . when i thought i had reached it , i took it as comfort that it would never get that bad again . but then it fucking did . so the disappointment from that made me spiral even more . my intent was the steer your focus away from that , so you do not have expectations that can be broken in the future . do you have a safety plan like , let us say right now you lost your home and your job . what would you do who can you call . write that shit down , call up friends family and explain how things are and if you can rely on them in case of emergency . then include them in the plan . being vulnerable and asking for help is a sign of strength of character . if someone judges you for it , then they were not really looking out for your best interests were they if you come up with a plan now , it will help you take a logical and safe course of action if things go south . depression has a way of taking away logic and rational behavior . write down phone numbers of local charities and shelters , so you can have a backup backup plan . if you have pets , do you have anyone who could take care of them etc . get this stuff out of the way now , so your mental resources can be dedicated to fixing a problem should it arise i gather you are in america do you have some kind of unemployment scheme for sick people if so , look into the requirements for that . in my country i am lucky enough to have had that safety net when i had a breakdown , resulting in me quitting my job and becoming housebound for a while . i really do hope your country has something similar . having time to heal is so important and it pains me to hear you have to put rent above your mental health . i guess people do it clot in society anyway , but when you have a mental illness that could result in your death the stakes get raised a bit . if you do not have a social security system that allows for sickness payments , are there charities that do perhaps you could volunteer there or something . surely a first world country can look after its sick people right as for the bipolar thing , do not let me put ideas into your head . it is just something to file away and keep in mind . i actually was in denial at first , when i got diagnosed . depression seemed like a simpler label , so i was reluctant to let go . i did not even look at bipolar symptoms , as i was scared if it confirmed my diagnosis . boy did it smack me in the face when i did read them , i ticked every box . what i am trying to say is , we are biased as fuck and should never be trusted to put weight into a diagnosis . let the psych do that . but , if you have suspicions and the psych dismisses them you should possibly try someone else . <end>"

146,<start> my battle with depression and attempted suicide <end>,"<start> hey there , it is great to see the story of an adult , especially when you had a family and a stable job . depression is a growing issue in teens and many feel unable to even survive economically once they leave school , so seeing someone who was successful and still had depression should be a clear reminder that anyone can suffer from it . it was a miracle that gun did not fire and i am glad you were able to open up . it is an inspiring story for many to see how you survived losing so much but realising what you still had . thank you <end>"

159,<start> i do not feel anything <end>,"<start> i am very sorry that you are experiencing this . it is a rough place to be . are you able to get in to see a doctor meds do not help everyone but they can be a good place to start if the chemicals in your brain are not functioning the best so you can do the things you need to do to get better . i still fall into my pit . i get suicidal and i get numb like you are describing . i am not sure if i am the best person to answer this but i will list some things that have helped decrease the amount of time i spend in my pit . for reference , i dropped out of college because i did not know who to turn to for help and i would spend weeks lying on the floor of my apartment before my mind would let me leave . this was around . now days , i spend about to days in my pit before i am able to crawl out and try to live life again . . reading . mainly about stoicism , buddhism , meditation , cognitive behavioral therapy , and borderline personality disorder . . exercise . i prefer weights to cardo but try and do both . i am not that consistent and can go weeks without working out . . eating less sugar . when i get in my whole i do not want to cook so i will go buy frozen meals and convenience shit like instant oatmeal and yogurt . not the best but better than my preferred meals of droits and sugar cookies . . this one is big and this one is tough . finding someone who will remind me of all these things when i am in my pit and start lying to myself that i am not making progress and i am worthless . it is hard to do on your own but it can be done . more in . . journal . good and bad . when you feel up go back and challenge the down thoughts . prove to yourself that that the depression is a lying sack of shit in any way you can . for me , this helps subconsciously i think . when i drop , i will swear up and down that none of the above is true or worth it . i will find any and every thought the proves what i fuck up i am , but i have noticed that there is a small voice that is fighting back . . practice patience and kindness with yourself . super hard as well but worth it . i am still learning this . i do not have tips for this one . . podcast have helped me when no one is around . i know i have one person . one friend . i have pushed everyone else away . i tried to push him away yesterday but he fights for me . however he can not be there all the time . right now i am binging new mindset , who dis by case kenny . love it . . cannabis . it gives me panic attacks if i smoke too much . but the pros out weigh the cons for me . out of all the anti depression and anti psychotics i have taken , it works the best for me . i want to try micro dosing lsd or rooms in the future . or to go on a therapeutic trip with a seasoned guide . these are in no particular order . i am by no means an authority or cured in any way . i could drop into my pit tomorrow and swear to you that a car crash off the bridge is the way to go , but today , right now , my mind is settled and i realize that the slow and snail like progress i have made is working . i wish you the best and i hope you find some coping strategies that will work for you and your future self . much love and sending hugs from the midwest . edit also wanted to say even a baby step is still a step . just try and focus on one baby step at time . try , hard for me , to focus on doing that one baby step until it is done . <end>"
160,<start> am i a failure <end>,"<start> you are not a failure . i am about your age and in a pretty similar situation living with my parents . sometimes life throws us into scenarios that do not match where we think we should be . there are a lot of other young people also still living with family out there . it is really really expensive to live independently these days , way worse than when our parents were our age . i have a reasonably good paying job for someone who never went to college but i live in a pretty expensive metropolitan area so when i move out i will still have to have roommates . my girlfriend makes two dollars more an hour than i do and has her own studio but she can not afford furniture for now . you are not a failure , things are just crazy broken economically right now . you are not in this situation because you did the wrong thing . <end>"

186,<start> on my own now <end>,"<start> depression and suicidal ideation is like a deep hole that feels impossible to climb out , especially if it is part of your identity . something that helped me a lot was thinking about qualities that i valued . think about the kind of life you want to live . what kind of person do you want to be it might be that depression has been attached to you for a long time , so thinking about yourself in a different way can feel very odd . practice envisioning a life worth living as they call it in therapy . create a list of values you see yourself having in the future if you were able to overcome your depression . for example , mine are honesty , connection , authenticity , generosity , kindness , and open mindedness . hopefully this can help you see a different point of view on life and who you are . after that , you can start finding activities that align with your values which will help lift your mood and sense of purpose . it is wunna be a long journey , but i can promise you that things will get better . <end>"

192,<start> any tips for moving on <end>,"<start> regret and change are things many of us hate , and we can not go back , as much as i and many others wish we could . but you said it yourself , you are in healthier friendships and clearly enjoy uni . you managed to move forward and make yourself better as a person . cherish the best moments of your past , and use them as a ground for what makes you yourself . and do not be afraid to move forward and take further jumps , you are not leaving anything behind . <end>"
193,<start> what are things an so can do to help alleviate your depression <end>,"<start> i think the best thing you can offer him is patience . i have been the depressed partner in the past , and i think it might benefit you to ask him a few questions on a good day for him , like what makes you feel supported can you tell me about some things people have done in the past that have made you feel worse i also sincerely recommend that you seek out a therapist for yourself if you see this relationship as something that could potentially be long term , or , if you so is currently in therapy which i hope he is , you might ask if he would like you to join him for a few sessions so you can discuss this together in a mediated environment . i did this with a partner and it was very , very helpful . good luck . you seem very thoughtful , but please do not forget that ultimately you are not culpable for his feelings , his illness , or his wellness . <end>"
194,<start> did not really know where else to go <end>,<start> i have the same issue and i did relapse once it is not worth it it just feels worse . please do not do it you do not deserve that pain . try your hardest to keep busy and distracted . <end>
195,<start> what to do if you think someone might be depressed <end>,"<start> always be more upfront and honest . it may end up being uncomfortable for everyone involved , but it will always get you moving in right direction , the fastest . avoid being overly pushy , but i have dark moments very often and if a friend were to ask me if something was wrong or if i was feeling bad , i would either be dismissive or honest . an are you sure might break through to me , but anything more and i would get tense and more distant . you definitely want to discuss the context of the depression before trying to work on it . my advice otherwise is just be patient , be honest and be there for your cousin as much as you can . <end>"

234,<start> i am drowning and it is getting harder to come up for air . <end>,"<start> i want to start by saying sorry that you feel this way . i have been struggling with depression over years now . it started very similar for me as well . i have changed my university subject times and they were all private universities . i was still living with my mother . she never complained about anything but i felt like the same . especially because my sister went to one of the best public university , she always found scholarship for her further education . i could not stop feeling like a failure and i was making it worse for my family . x b at first , i was just thinking and feeling these but still had a happy face . after a while i started drinking alcohol a lot . at time i was just thinking as having fun but it was a call for help . i started arguing with my friends . after a while they stopped calling or testing me because i was a mood killer . one night when i was out with my best friend i got really drunk and we start arguing . she said you only have friends because i am your friend but i can not stand you anymore . that was it . being drunk and what has said i think without considering too much i took painkillers to get rid of my headache . it was more than i should take . a part of me had it enough i guess . i woke my mother up telling her i am not feeling very well . we went to er . x b after that night i realised that i needed to get help . i could not cope with this anymore . so i went to see a doctor . i am still on medication because she said i have repetitive depression and it is hard to know when i can have another depression attack . i feel so much better though . i stop talking to everyone who left me alone when i was vulnerable . i talked to my family and i was very upfront about it . they are really supportive . i was also scared that everyone will treat me differently and no one will want anything to do with me . but it was not like that . at first they were more understanding if i had problems but now everything is how it used to be but i have better friends , a partner that really supports me and a family that knows i am trying my best . x b i know that everyone s experience is different but i think you should get help . your family will understand and support you . it is better to get that support than feeling that way . with friends and relationships you will find people who do not treat you like a sick child and who understands your problems . if people can not handle you at your worst they do not deserve to be with you at your best . <end>"

248,<start> is it how to stubbornly refuse to be miserable thanks . <end>,<start> ah yes forgot the stubbornly part <end>
249,<start> waiting for bad things <end>,"<start> depression can often distort our logical senses , making us panic and feel depressed out of habit , when in reality there is nothing wrong . i remember that in psychology , they explained that the brain activates a sense of pleasure , like having an addiction , out of being sad . i have as well dealt with depression my whole life and this can often impact how we deal with our sadness , where at some degree we become addicted without noticing unconsciously . after a long time we build a predisposition to see everything go wrong or bad , but to this you must rationalize and see the logistics of the situation . i can understand that this may not be a quick process but try breathing exercises and think positively . because at the end of the day you can go two ways , you can think negatively or positively and the path that can lead us to be more productive is staying in a positive note . now l understand that is a lot different when people do not answer your calls , the world may start to take a negative aspect . making us feel even worse from the current situation that we are already confronting . but don try to jump to conclusions the mind can be very deceiving as i said before , trying to be positive can be productive along the way . i also understand your frustration when it come to other folks not helping . but unfortunately many folks do no go out of their way to help bystanders . again in psychology is call the bystander effect . but try to not center your attention on others , since these are factors that are out of control . i can understand that it may be discouraging to be alone . now , you are not the only one that struggles with these thoughts . many of us here do but its up to to us to to work towards our fears to enjoy our life once again . i had heard this quote from a game and its pretty inspirational struggle is an illusion . the only chains that bind you are the ones you accept . it maybe be a long a painful journey but soon enough you will get there , small baby steps are better than none . we believe in you and do not lose hope . <end>"
250,"<start> sudden feelings of emptiness , what do i do rant kinda <end>","<start> hello friend . so let me give you my opinion on some things . my mood constantly changes . i have been thinking about this for myself and friends and i think it is rather normal if you feel depressed but are constantly trying to get better and function properly and push forward , it is normal to experience these ups and downs . now that i write this i realise i also have to mention be careful if you are taking any medication that they are taken properly , otherwise they might because these mood swings , obviously that is a different matter i do not know how to control it . i do not think it can be controlled , you can control your actions for the most part though . no need to panic , find some things that calm you , maybe eat something do not overeat , or maybe lie down for a little while and take some time to get back into the game . this is just me talking , and i am not an expert . i think you might find other techniques , maybe it is worth looking online for some stuff . whenever i start feeling bad , whenever my mood goes down , i feel nothing . imo it is a coping mechanism sometimes better to feel nothing than feel bad . it is a nice chance to think calmly . is there any way to battle this feeling again i am not an expert but as far as i know we can not pinpoint a solution to one specific thing , even if it is different for every person . but i think you will find things cover a lot of stuff the everyday habits , especially work study and exercise . exercise will make you feel better and while it may seem only treating a symptom do not underestimate it . in the case of the depression , the symptom can also be a because , it would not be a vicious cycle otherwise . with work study there is no negotiation , you need a reason to get out of bed no matter what , and hold yourself accountable . talking therapy either to help put some of your thoughts in order or even discuss philosophically about things that might be getting you down . it does not have to be a therapist , it can be friends and family , but if you feel a therapist might help do not hesitate in any way . medication i guess it is just true our feelings depend on chemistry so it is not so bad to get a boost if needed . always on advice of a medical professional of course . recently , my desire to selfward has been on the rise , too . i started selfharming more than a year ago and currently i was almost three weeks clean . was . i was beating my legs for a while . again i will say it is to be expected wanting to self harm on some really bad days . but if you ask me , it is simply , wrong . it does not help anything , it only adds more problems . i will not even try to argue about this . like , if i try i guess i can imagine some very few people with an extreme and rare mental condition may resort to this and may need serious help to stop . but i would assume this is not the case with you . just do not do it . i do not know how else to say it . hit a pillow or something . not yourself . i do my hobbies almost everyday , i try my hardest to go outside and communicate with people that is good . it might not be enough , actually it obviously is not . but that does not mean you are wrong by doing these things . you managed to not abandon your hobbies and not isolate yourself , that is actually really really important . keep it up . this feeling keeps coming back again and again . it might disappear immediately . or it might take some time . do not give up . x b i hope some stuff i wrote were helpful . if not i am sorry but feel free to reply to this if you want . <end>"

296,<start> how do you deal with being broke and depressed <end>,"<start> yep i went through this same thing for years all of my s which is why i was never able to defeat depression . i had to drop out of school could never hold a job the same old story we hear all the time on here . now that i am , i am back in school and doing an online program . i am financing my therapy out of pocket with student loans as part of my living expenses and making progress for the first time . insurance would never pay and this is the only way i could make it work . i honestly do not know how people do it but like i said it took me years of severe suffering to finally get it set up for i could get the help i needed and in the meantime i lost everything including my family , my friends , my boyfriend . . . i wasted time on medications that made me gain hundreds of pounds and did not work at all . . . i hope you can find a way soon . . . think about going back to school possibly online so that you can be available during the day when therapists have their therapy sessions . that is the only thing that worked for me and then you can finance it with some of your student loans as your living expenses . if you find another way to make it work please let us know so that others can be helped and our community of support can continue to foster know that we are here for you and all care and believe very much in what you are going through currently . good luck <end>"

388,<start> i do not think therapy is helping <end>,"<start> i do not know if this is helpful , but i have a couple things to share first , it is totally normal to not jive with every therapist . it may not feel worth it , but i would really encourage you to try another person . i know it can take a lot to even seek help in the first place and starting over has no guarantee of working . but it can be worth trying . second , it is okay to tell them you do not think their approach is working . they are or should be pros and can take it . even if these are not of value for you , i am still wishing you the best . trust yourself <end>"

401,"<start> do not know where to go , please help <end>","<start> i am so sorry you have been through all of this . i know you are embarrassed about admitting this to your family , but that is what family is for . also , if depression is a common side effect of a stroke , it seems like you should be able to talk to your doctor about this . <end>"
402,<start> i feel so helpless <end>,"<start> you are right antidepressants are not a miracle cure for what ails us . as you are already seen , what they actually do is help clear our heads so we can face down the real problems . however , getting the right antidepressant can be a tedious , uphill climb . i often say that we are our own guinea pigs . when it comes to any kind of medication designed for psychiatric use , it is not unusual to have to keep trying different types and dosages . you should not have to feel that way and the meds are designed to help . but , if you are on the wrong type and or dosage , they do not . i strongly recommend that you go back to your provider . the only way the provider can know if a med works or not is if you tell them they will recommend something else , based on your feedback . <end>"
403,<start> how am i supposed to feel after going to the psychologist <end>,"<start> cards on the table , i am a social worker who worked as a therapist . i have a different perspective to offer on this i think . i believe a more productive way to think about therapy than no pain no gain might be more like a lock and key situation . there are a bunch of variables on the side of the client what is happened , what is happening , etc , and there are a bunch of variables on the side of the therapist how they work , what they believe , what their training is , what their individual skillet is . there are lots of different models of therapy . these models sit on philosophical frameworks which are also quite diverse . each therapist has their own thinking about therapy , or philosophy and frameworks they are skilled in . getting back to the lock and key , the matter of whether therapy is likely to work for a client is to some extent a feature of what models the therapist is using . its also well known that there are factors that can negate the extent to which models affect quality of therapy and these are relationship based . in other words , if the therapist and client personally click this may be a significant driving factor in how well therapy works . its relational to some extent . getting back to the models , one way of thinking of them is two schools of thought . depth psychology , which is about what happened , what meaning was made of what happened , and how the person responded or reacted to what happened . it may also consider a lot of the persons experience to be the result of subconscious or deep thinking . forward facing models , which are concerned with what is happening now , what meanings people are making of things in the present , how well that current stuff is working , and what can be done to improve it . you may be able to see from this that is more likely to require clients and therapists to engage in no pain no gain thinking , and may not require it . that is not to say that might not involve some discomfort by challenging current conceptions of how to manage things but the way the two approaches that we are using for the sake of argument is probably distinguishable this way . and that is kind of important for clients to know . unfortunately , going into therapy , most do not , and they get stuck with whatever therapist and whatever model is their particular preference . this can be unhelpful for some clients . i believe practiced unskillfully , it can certainly be harmful . i do not want to get into that too much here because this post is getting pretty long . i think the best thing to do is figure out whether you want to be talking a lot about your past and if you feel that would work for you based on what you know from your experience so far or if you would find it more useful to be talking about wheats happening now , and where things are heading from here . if unsure , it might be worth trying a different therapist and model to learn more about what fits best for you . <end>"

584,<start> do you mind sharing what happened in those years going through something similar atm <end>,"<start> well , i did not have enough grades to make it to uni right after high school . even tho , my parents wanted me to be a medical doctor , since they were both medical doctors . i did not really have a dream job of my own , although i did say i want to be a psychiatrist since i hated needles , and that seemed like the only job in medicine that would not need needles . i also did not live with my parents since elementary they were back in my home country . which did not help relationship with my parents either . since , we had so much differences from being separated . so , surprise surprise , when their child at the end of high school , did not even have enough grades to go to college , let alone intention to pursue medicine . i have been constantly thinking about suicide during high school , and it seemed like worrying about my future at all is a pointless endeavor . although , i never self harmed or attempted suicide . so , i literally lived the moment , except instead of a party and all that jazz , it was just sleep and food that attended my life . in order to avoid being a high school graduated and to avoid my conscription biggest reason why hikkikomori is not as big problem in my country as japan back in my home country . i started attending an animation school , for a diploma . it was occupying few floors on a small building in the middle of auckland city . my parents thought this was the worst school they ever seen . my mother literally cried at how shit it was . but , as asian parents they gave me funds to study animation anyway . while studying computer animation so like d animation , like ds max , and watching japanese animation i played a lot of morphs , one of them gave me a chance to be a game master at a private server with about concurrent users at any given time . between that and watching how avatar was made in short documentary couture videos , which predicted animator as a job is a dying field since it will be replaced by computer programs who can make computer animation for them . anyway , the game master thing was an eye opener for me , since i never knew how much i would enjoy other people enjoying what i think would enjoy . so , after finishing barely because my first year instructor hated my guts , second year instructor was a grumpy old man , and maybe a little bit racist , while my third year instructor was a dick and i hope he dies in a slow and painful manner . so , i would just stay in my room , and not go to class , and attendance rate was a thing animation , i went back to my home country for conscription . my time in the army was not that bad . the month long rootcap was fun enough , altho i would not do it ever again . instead of going in to army directly , i went to civil service , so i was working along with government officials in a local community center . if the pay was not shit which is below minimum wage since it is conscription , i would have loved to work like that for the rest of my life because i nearly did not need to do anything . once in a while , i would help other government officials move some boxes , send posts , and deliver confidential documents . but , mostly i played flash games on the work computers . when they later blocked it . i just started using proxy web services or http . the most serious thing i was most called for was it or translation , which was not a lot . since , one of my government official did not even know what windows was , i was the only guy with computer related knowledge . anyway , during the two years , my parents wanted me to at least have a college degree . so they tried to put me up to get in to a college . which required my high school records , except new zealand high school i attended told me they do not have a record of me . so , basically i did not even graduate high school . so , i had to take a ged . eventually i managed to enter an university in us . which was okay at first . since , everything was metaphorically new and shiny to me . i went to a school psychologist my first year there . who i convinced to see the school psychiatrist . who told me he thought i am having depressive episodes but he did not think i had depression yet on first few diagnosis . eventually , i lost interest in education , so my grades slipped . went from . on my first semester to failing academic standard by third semester . so , eventually school said come back when you feel like studying and academically dismissed me . i went to a community school after that , but for me , this was worse than my animation school in new zealand . there were metal detectors , and clogged toilets everywhere . literal shit school if you ask me . anyway , i stopped attending there altogether too . i think i went to the community school a dozen times during that semester , and half of that was to hand in applications , before finally deciding education is not right for me , at the end of that semester . unfortunately , my parents did not agree that i wanted to drop out . they would constantly berate about how technically , i did not even graduate from high school since my new zealand high school did not recognize me as a graduate , and that ged does not count . it was not like i could live separately from them with no income . especially as an asian , where independence from family does not come automatically when you are like in america . so , after about month , i sent in a request for readmission at my first university , whom they accepted . soon enough depression came down hard again so i would just stay in my room , and not do anything . so , i went to the psychiatrist in us again . despite my parents telling me not to go seek a psychiatrist since according to them they will use me for their experiments . i kept getting told by a whole lot of people that maybe i did not make the cut to be studying the major i chose , so i finally caved in and i tried changing that too . but , nope . i guess that was not it either . because i lost interest in everything all over again . so , i am a college drop out right now . with no job , no employment history , no training whatsoever . the school psychiatrist in us would give me medication , but i could not book them before the meds ran out . once it ran out , for me , i fell harder because i was higher up . it was like having an allergy your whole life , then took the cure for it , but then when your allergy returns , you suddenly can not breathe . since , you are not used to having clogged breadthways any longer . well , that is how i would describe my experience with the medication . also , it taking a few weeks to see any serious effect and is not a immediate happy pill did not help return immediately to a more normal life . few weeks to see the psychiatrist few weeks to start the med effect back up months of depression autopiloting my life , where i just get back to my oneself . at least when i went to see a psychiatrist back in my home country last year , they took my experience in us for it , and i did not have to make lengthy series of appointment to convince them i had depression . <end>"

650,<start> should i admit myself into a psych hospital <end>,"<start> first , thank you for being strong enough to come forward and ask for help i am not your mom , but i am more than old enough to be her . i have dealt with depression and ptsd myself for a while now . none of these things are for wimps . if i were your mother , i would want you to get the best help you could get . whether that is therapy and or meds and or something else . your mom will be far , far more heartbroken if you hurt or kill yourself and will blame herself . the problem here is potentially that your mother may feel like a failure if you get help . but the thing is that is her problem , not your problem . your job is to get help for yourself . being strong enough to ask for help is wonderful . her job is to support you in what you need . her emotional state is not what is really at stake here . it is yours . <end>"

777,<start> been in a state of self hatred self blame lately . <end>,"<start> this is my first time replying to a reedit post so i will try my best . to start off , it is not your fault that you had have social anxiety , you did not ask for it just like thousands if not millions of others around the world , and having social anxiety will prevent you from speaking out in situations such as the one you mentioned , it would be too much to handle . you have got to realise that having social anxiety prevents you from doing things , it does not make them physically impossible , but to overcome the anxiety in a situation like that would take a lot of sacrifice and could have severe effects on your anxiety after that , so not being able to overcome your anxiety is not your fault , it was built into you and nothing could be done about it . if you had a broken legs and were asked to run m , technically you could do it but realistically , you can not . you should see that a mental illness , such as social anxiety , is no different than a physical illness or injury , and you would not blame yourself for not being able to run m with broken legs would you so why should you for this situation . also its not about the action that matters , its the thought , and you wanted to help , even though you may not have spoken out , which you could not of due to your situation , you wanted to and that is the best anyone could have done in your situation . i know you may feel like you watched these acts happen and did nothing about it to help , therefore it is your fault , but that is realistically not true . you were not the root of the problem , therefore even if somehow you overcame your social anxiety which is very very rare and not many people can do , it would not of changed much as you were not the root of the problem , you can not change the way your father acted , that is down to him . also try and put anyone else in that situation , with the levels of social anxiety you had and also your verbal levels , no one could have done better than you did . people blame themselves for things happening all the time as they did not interfere , yet they fail to realise that interfering does not change the root of the problem and can actually make it worse sometimes , so do not blame yourself for not being able to speak , you yourself know there is nothing you could do about it , and that speaking would not of changed your fathers acts . sometimes there are things in life that we can simply not help , feeling helpless is common , however you should never feel like you are the blame , and deep down you know that your e not . <end>"

783,"<start> those are definitely always good rules to live by , i am with you there . i have been eating overall healthier food within the past few months due to some digestive issues awhile back . although i have slip ups occasionally , but i have been pretty consistent . it is a slow process . my newest endeavor has been eliminating enriched flour from my diet and substituting whole grain . in my opinion , it is been one of the easiest dietary habits to build . sugar though oh man , that would be a tough one sugar is in evvvvverything and the substitutes do not always turn out to be healthier after studies over time . not to mention my insane sweet tooth . i have made an effort on several occasions within the last month to make sweet treats at home since almost anything homemade is healthier and you can see what is going into it . i still slip up sometimes , but i am getting there can i ask you for any tips or tricks that make a lasting impression fiber yogurt i have been slacking on getting back to exercising coming out of this winter , but , oddly enough , i have been getting more rigorous exercise the past few weeks . thank gob for the sunshine . i really like that you suggested some things outside of the medical realm . it is always a good idea to check those basics diet and exercise before getting too caught up . thank you for the reminder . i have been reading more and more that the bacteria in your digestive tract can because depression which is huge i feel like i should start taking probiotics again , i stopped bc i was too broke to afford them a couple years ago and kinda just let it slipped under my radar . <end>","<start> hi , sorry it took me a while to get back at you , i missed the reply notification . regarding sugar and flour , in my case i just simply reduced the amount of intake . like you i also have a sweet tooth and i love pizza , bread , pasta etc so i just buy or consume sweets when i have not had for a few days . in the end for me , diet is all about balance . if i have a slip up day , i make sure to have a few good ones following it . making your own sweets is a great way to know what you are consuming , but unfortunately i can not advise you on how to stop completely , i am myself not able to hah . what triggered me in trying to find new ways was the fact my medicine was not effective anymore and i did not like the prospect of trying a new one and only knowing after a few months if it worked . i have had intestinal problems getting used to the dutch culture short lunches and lots of bread and realized it was the same feeling as back then . when taking an anti inflammatory for other issues physical i have noticed i had a few good days afterwards . as you mentioned , after reading about gut flora and all , it was a quick and easy decision to try to help it . my breakfast is a bowl of a fiber source , yoghurt or milk and a fruit honey or jam to change it up a bit . like you , i also have my slip up days weeks and fail to follow my rules , but the trick i use is just accept the slip up and get back at it again . also , having a heavier lunch and earlier lighter dinner helped a lot too . back to the physical part , i would been using ill fitted shoes for a season , making my right foot cramp up . resulting in imbalanced walking . other sport related injuries added to the imbalance of my hips and neck . i had pains and issues literally from my head to toes . physiotherapy and yoga helped me target those areas and although i am not completely fit or in shape , i do not longer feel years older my age . it is also a long and slow process , as you have to bring everything back to and start building it up again but i can now fall asleep in under mins and stay asleep for hours without any extra meds those were nasty . therapy sessions are not a huge mind tangle anymore and i feel as i have only one thing left to work out why it is keeping me from growing out of this hole . i have now been a week without taking my meds own decision , i do not advise on stopping them yourself , it was a move made out of anger and not well thought out , without my therapist doc knowing , in short a dumb move but it felt as the right one i think i am quite alright at listening to my body . it payed off greatly for me as most outcomes so far are positives , the positive effects of the medicine were no longer there but the negative ones were . i am keeping track of my thoughts and feelings and will discuss it with my therapist next session , to make sure it is not just a periodic thing . this is all simplified but in general what happened in my situation many issues snowballed into a huge hole i am now slowly crawling out of . tlr what i am trying to say is pace and patience are key , slow and steady wins the race even though i lack those in my bad days . fix the little things you can , so you can free up resources to help with the bigger ones . i am always up for a chat or discussion if you or anyone else is willing to , hit me up <end>"

975,<start> why do people sometimes push others way when they are depressed <end>,"<start> i just read on another post depression can become its own comfort zone and that is definitely true . some would rather be depressed alone rather than talk about it , because it can be confrontational and because you are worried to be a burden on others or just anxiety about social interaction it can be all kinds of things . is there anything you can do not if he blocked your number , i suppose . but if you can contact him perhaps the one thing you can do is just tell him that he does not have to worry about those things and hope for the best . it is tough but you can not help someone if they try to not be helped . <end>"

991,<start> can you just define me so i can understand if i have <end>,"<start> basically you are scared af of abandonment you are always having paranoid thoughts about people you love leaving you or losing them in any way . you also exaggerate the consequences of their abandonment on your life . that leads to you seeking reassurance all the time and doing desperate gestures in order to keep them in your life , like going out of your way to please them or threating them with self harm in case they want to leave you . sometimes , you may also push their boundaries by being extremely mean rude to them , just to prove yourself they are not going to abandon you , not even at your worst behavior . <end>"
992,<start> stuck in a rut . how do i get out <end>,"<start> you are not lazy , depression kills motivation and energy . you are working really hard and you have a lot of things going on . if you can try making your to do lists smaller , setting yourself up for failure every single day is just being cruel to yourself . you need to give yourself a little breathing room . try putting your self care on your to do list , then you are looking after yourself and checking things off . i also put something really easy on there , a thing i have to do and i know i am kind of kidding myself but its another thing i would probably put off forget . if you have the ability try and rearrange a few things so you have a day to try and unwind with the basics to do , go for a coffee , clean your living space , go see a friend . personal time is so important for me otherwise i crash and burn after a while . maybe talk to a friend or family member and see if they can help with anything you are struggling with in my experience you are working harder than you think and you are likely doing better than you think you are . stress about organisation of events and things like that is completely normal but depression , anxiety and stress all lie to you , they make you doubt yourself , they make you feel like you are not doing enough . you are . no one will be as critical as you are , no one will notice the things you do . you have done what you can , that is all you could have done . it will be fine and now what is done is done and stressing can not change it . get through it best you can , try and except the fact you worked really hard and should give yourself a break . in my experience there is an awful lot of people out there , myself included that a lot of time they do not know what is going on , they do not quite get it , like they are a fraud , a failure and that life is overwhelming . all of that is a valid way to feel some times , life s hard , works confusing , people are difficult and a million other things make things tough and make you feel like you are drowning . all you can do when it gets really bad is make sure they cover the basics , self care is so important , talking really helps , eat well and try and realise before it gets to much that you are burning out so you can ease up on yourself . you are doing better than you think you are and people will appreciate all of your efforts . <end>"
993,<start> i do not know what to do please help <end>,"<start> this is not easy and i would recommend for you to brace for the worst . at this point the only thing for you to do would be to talk to him and explain how you feel . be open about it and tell him you fear he would leave , etc . time will tell what will happen but opening up at least would be a good start . <end>"
994,<start> got rejected for the first time and do not know what to do <end>,"<start> i know this will sound so cliche but you are so young . you are going to have so many more experiences and they will not all turn out like this one . some old lady once told me you got to kiss a lot of frogs before you find your prince princess . it will hurt for a little while but it will get better . when you get older and you find a great person , you will look back on all the ones that did not work out and you will be thankful they did not work even though it had been painful at the time . <end>"
995,<start> so tired of life <end>,"<start> th i have no idea what the right words are . i do not want you to die . i have no idea who you are but you deserve to watch your child grow up , to hear about their first day of school , to watch them graduate at the end of it all . you deserve to be at their wedding and be there when they have kids of their own . you deserve that . and they deserve to have a parent . if for northing else in this world , hang on for your kid . i hope this helps in some way . whatever you are going through , do not let it win . <end>"
996,<start> i am so tired all the time <end>,<start> i feel the same way . the only thing that pushes me is knowing i have to take care of my son . so i take my antidepressants and basically live off of caffeine . just try to accomplish one task a day . even if it is something small like doing dishes but not putting them away . it is hard and i feel your pain <end>
997,<start> in desperate need of distraction <end>,"<start> i do not have all the answers of course but it sounds like you may need to keep your distance away from this person if they trigger negative symptoms in you . surround yourself around things and ppl who make you feel good and understand you . if being around ppl is a struggle than stay to yourself until you get to the point where it is not a struggle , but also know your limits . do not force yourself into situations bc of fear of being alone . do you have a talent or hobby painting music some type of creative outlet also have you ever tried talking to a mental health doctor <end>"
998,<start> i do not know if things will get better <end>,<start> fuck . hope you are okay . <end>
999,<start> what is the point <end>,<start> it is very difficult to connect with new people . and loneliness is horrible especially as a man when you are expected to be strong and not say anything . i just hope you find a good support system <end>

1010,<start> depression sucks my chest hurts i wish i could be more positive <end>,<start> hope you are okay <end>
1011,<start> depressed vs just not wanting to do something <end>,"<start> one point of distinction is that when you are depressed looking at a thing you once cared about or derived value from is not the same experience . specifically , the thing which you enjoyed doing or pursued with determination in the past appears pointless . the pointlessness of the thing makes it hard to do , rather than it being hard to do because it is simply not a personal priority at that time . i think there is nothing wrong with simply deciding that something is no longer a priority ie housework , using a running machine , sketching . this is a normal thing people do when they are not depressed . they stop doing things , and start others as a normal matter of course . there is a problem when many or all of the things you once enjoyed look like crap , and you stop doing all the stuff that once made you happy because it is all become blew . <end>"

1019,<start> situational depression <end>,<start> when i was in my first long term relationship i experienced those bursts in the sense that i was only okay when i was near my girlfriend . and before that was constant . most people feel like that when something or someone is not present at the moment and they are not doing anything productive . for me music and art was something to keep me occupied and happy with being by myself without anyone else . i suggest any kind of hobby that distracts you while keeping you engaged in self expression would help very much . <end>

1023,<start> i can not stop crying <end>,"<start> let yourself cry my therapist said , the more you try to quash the emotion or berate yourself for it , the larger it looms in your mind . it is like if i told you do not think about an elephant you will think more about the elephant than before . just let the emotions flow , and take a curiosity toward them , but do not feel guilty for having them sending love <end>"
1024,<start> brain games exercises to help brain recover from depression . <end>,"<start> it is going to sound cliche but personally i have found meditation and journaling to be helpful . for meditation , i really like the app oak , it only has a few guided meditations but you can also set an unguided one and it is completely free . i am trying out headspace now and it is not bad but kind of obnoxious how it wants you to upgrade to a paid account all the time . with journaling , i will try to do it right after meditating , and i just write about whatever comes to mind . occasionally i will pull up a list of questions to ask yourself in interest and pick one to write about , but i find just getting my thoughts out of my head is the most helpful . if you write anything negative about yourself , scratch it out and write something positive to help shift your mindset . i also always mark the next blank page so i do not go back and reread my previous entries , not sure why but it helps me to just leave those old thoughts in the past . i hope you get better soon <end>"

1084,<start> what are some safe and efficient antidepressants <end>,"<start> antidepressants are not meant to treat laziness or provide you with discipline that is not how human behaviour works , and certainly is not reflective of what depression actually is . i would first go to see a gp primary care doctor and find out whether you do indeed have any symptoms that would benefit from an antidepressant . if you do end up taking one , i am afraid there does not exist a medication with no side effects whatsoever . the common antidepressant classes are not addictive i . e . typically do not tend to because withdrawal symptoms but all require slow weaning to prevent relapse of symptoms . the most commonly prescribed first line antidepressants sris such as fluoxetine , servaline , citalopram have few serious side effects compared with other classes that were more popular first line treatments in the past , but again no such thing as a drug without side effects . <end>"

1092,<start> i hear voices and i need someone in my life who can help me <end>,"<start> sorry you are feeling like this . lots of people have a sort of internal monologue , and plenty even say those internal thoughts to themselves this is quite normal , as long as you are able to recognise that the voice originates from you i . e . those are your own thoughts , and do not feel like thoughts that have been planted there by originate from someone else . if you are experiencing the latter , e . g . feeling you are overhearing other people s voices when you are alone , or feeling like someone is actually putting thoughts into your head , and you are convinced that this is really happening , these are symptoms of psychosis , which can be seen in schizophrenia , bipolar disorder and extreme depression . if that is the case , you need to seek medical help . in terms of the loneliness i understand , but even though it seems endless , high school will pass . i connected with very few people at high school or secondary school where i am from , and part of the problem is that you are lumped together in classes with people with whom you may have nothing in common you do not get to choose the people you are stuck with most of the time . this changes somewhat after high school it is easier to choose your companions at , say , university , and on top of that the majority of people are less mean you obviously still get some cruel people , but the outside world is not the same as the vipers nest that is high school . in the meantime while you might be struggling to make friends at school , how about outside school what do you enjoy sport film photography walking outdoors board games reading art cycling there may well be societies for some all of these things near where you live , and the internet will be able to tell you for certain . even if you can not think of anything you are into that would have a society , you could always consider taking up one of those things as a new hobby and meeting people that way . you may even find a girlfriend this way , if that is what you would like . good luck with it i was also bullied quite badly for a period in secondary school , and i can not tell you how much easier life can become in terms of making friends and enjoying life , once you are able to choose your own . keep pushing through you have got this <end>"

1098,<start> what can i do about depression after a scare <end>,"<start> i would maybe try to express that you may not like this about yourself and wish it did not happen , but it really just feels like something that is a part of you and therefore should not be exploited . like maybe hey , you know how some people are criers at movies it is not like people want to cry , generally , so they are not trying to make that happen . that is just how they are . that is kinda how i am with jump scares . and i feel a bit uncomfortable and crappy that you guys use that for personal amusement . you would not show a crier sad shit just to see them in action , right like when i get jump scared , my mind just shuts down for a couple days . i may not be crying or something else external , but my thoughts just go out of whack every time , and i am the one who has to deal with it , not you guys . <end>"

1107,<start> my soul has been burnt almost completely <end>,"<start> i am so sorry that you are feeling this way . i know how you feel , though . i am going through , feeling and thinking some of the same things . i do not want to make this about me , though . i definitely think you need to find a counselor that specializes in grief and trauma . maybe someone whose skilled in cognitive behavioral therapy . you have gone through some great loss , and the loneliness , emptiness and depression you are experiencing is normal and expected . your desire to be with your loved ones is only natural , but they would never want you to hurt yourself . they love you and would want you to try to go on living until it is your time , naturally , to go home . you have got to make that first step and reach out to a counselor that can help you deal with your feelings . there are people that care about you on this earth that would be so very sad if you were not here anymore . i care , and i only know you from what you have written . i am also here if you want to talk . if the feelings and thoughts you are having become overwhelming , please go to your nearest emergency room , or contact a suicide prevention center . just remember , there are people who do care about you and will be there for you in your time of suffering . <end>"
1108,<start> am i depressed or deeply insecure <end>,"<start> i cannot diagnose you , but i will say that you clearly are not happy , and in a bad place . whether you are clinically depressed , or deeply insecure either sound very painful to be going through . whatever the because i think you could benefit from seeing a psychologist or psychiatrist . in the past i would always write my pain off as not bad enough to justify wasting a professional s time , maybe if i could just pull myself together a bit , but honestly they are there to help with these things . also a big benefit i found was that they are removed from your social circle , so if you talk about things that you would be uncomfortable telling your friends , you do not have to worry about people treating you differently or whatever . not that you have to hide these feelings , but for me i definitely felt more comfortable knowing i could control when i felt like sharing something to friends . while you would not to tell them what you are experiencing if you do not want , do you think your parents or maybe an aunt or uncle , would help you see a psychologist or something i am not saying that like it is easy to reach out , i definitely struggled with it , but if you trust someone enough to help you see a professional i think that would be very helpful . <end>"

1135,<start> i am depressed and do not know what to do . <end>,"<start> these things can be very difficult to talk about , especially because most people think since they are a good person they would recognize depression in someone . it is hard to explain that nothing is wrong , and you still feel horrible which is why you are saying it is a problem . i would suggest looking into how to see a psychologist or psychiatrist in your area to get checked out , i would also suggest trying to gather some couture videos or reedit posts that seem to resonate with you . it can be hard to explain on your own , so i found finding other sources that helped put things into words was very helpful for me for explaining to others . what i liked about seeing a professional was that they were removed from my social circle , so when i was being honest about some of the fucked up thoughts i was having , it stayed between them and me if that is what i wanted . i was miserable most of my life even though technically things around me were good , and even today it is hard to explain to some people that i was still depressed because none of that stuff matters for my clinical depression . it was not about how great people were to me , or the opportunities i had . i am on medication now and i finally do not feel miserable all the time for no reason . i am not saying that ll be the route you take , but i am definitely glad i got seen because all the well meaning people in my life could not help me , and they and also myself actually could not understand how something external was not the problem . i am not saying your family will not be supportive , but there can be a big communication gap with this stuff . <end>"

1154,"<start> i feel so fake just feeling like crap . it hits me harder and harder everyday . i put on a fake smile and try to move on but man i feel like a failure to my own self , i hate myself , and i am not worthy of anything or anyone . maybe that is why the universe prefers me alone . <end>","<start> hey you are not alone i feel like this a lot sometimes . if you feel like your friends are not there for you i will be there for you . i do not know you but i do not need to know you , because i know you are strong and smart and are going to do great things in life . this is just a rough patch but do not worry there are people to help you through it . they could be friends or family or even complete strangers . just do not be afraid to let people in . <end>"

1156,<start> i need motivation to finish my studies <end>,<start> you have my support . it seems you have worked very hard and are just burnt out . i feel you should give yourself credit for coming so far and push yourself because you deserve the reward <end>
1157,<start> not sure if i am depressed <end>,"<start> i am sorry you are feeling this way the ups and downs are soosoo draining . they are so unpredictable . just regular stuff like getting to or from work is hard when you are feeling down . it creates trepidation for planning future events because you do not know how you will be feeling and if you will be up to it at that moment . it is ok to seek help at this point , if you need to hear some support that way . a general doc could run some tests and could also could give you a referral for specific help . as for more of definition of depression , to see if it applies to you , it is hard to tell . the fact that you would like the roller coaster to level off is enough of a situation in itself to merit getting help . you do not need to be officially depressed to ask for help . i hope it turns out all ok for you soon . <end>"

1172,<start> dating but still depressed <end>,"<start> there is one thing that took me from to to realize . no one , not one solid fucking human will ever make it better . not by themselves . they can help . they can be the light on a dark day , make you laugh even as you cry , but in the end , they will never fill that void . i know it sounds cheery , but it really really comes from within . and i know , it sounds easier and harder than ever , but it is true and different for each person . the only way i explain , is for me , i had everything . i had an apartment , i was working on a social media startup as head of marketing , dating the ceo , at after dropping out of college mind you , everything i always thought i wanted . and every day , every second , the feeling of panic , empty , aching , panic , grew . i just knew i had to run . and after four years , i did . i moved cities , was crashing in a friends spare room , fixing phones and striping on the side just to pay for my meds . it was hard , i missed him , i missed the people , but i never missed the life . in fact , i was happy ish . i used my phone repair job to talk my way into consulting on an episode of mr . precedes and worked with brandon lesson . i realized through my striping job that i was a goth badass who is scars from picking did not matter . i found my confidence . in life and body . it took going from the best to the worst to realize that is all personal . the only happiness comes from satisfaction of self . i tried to make myself happy through doing what should be . it was not until i stopped trying to fill the hole with the perfect guy , the perfect life , the perfect job , and just was , for a while . on my own , with no expectations beyond feeding myself and my dog , just existing , that i found myself . that was when i realized i am most content with malcontent . i love living life on my toes , reacting , bantering , getting that sale , landing that dance . everything i was told would be wrong , was right . and yes , i realize i kinda branched from dating , but the concept still applies . i would bet money i do not have that many ppl have tried to fill that hole with many different things i mean , addiction and depression are a problem for a reason but , as hard as it is , you have to reach around that hole , and find yourself . i was taught to list my interests , from most important to least , by a doc , you read the list and use it to remind yourself there is different ways to define yourself beyond has guy or is depressed or cries and move to can recite the entire year plot of one piece by heart or can dismantle an phone blindfolded in minutes . remind you what makes you . i have dragged on way too much . anywhy , friend , feel free to pm me , i will talk , shoot the shit , listen to rants , lend a shoulder to cry , anything . i am pretty lonely right now , myself , so i am reachable any time . just ask i hope this is not too much of a novel d <end>"

1176,<start> is anyone happy <end>,"<start> i can tell you i am never happy and i think part of my depression is thinking everyone around me is happy all the time and i can never attain that . i have been trying to do all the right things in life and life only hands me more misery . i have struggled for so long , so i feel your pain . i think we just learn how to get by and manage our depression as best we can . what helps me sometimes is finding something that will make my brain stop racing , for me that is exercise and keeping a routine . that is not to say at any moment i can crumble again . but i would say just try and find one little thing where you forget all the bs and force yourself to do it . but as far as obtaining happiness , i am still searching . <end>"
1177,<start> i need someone to talk to <end>,<start> i am here for you <end>
1178,<start> any advice appreciated <end>,"<start> you are very thoughtful about trying to do what is best for your friend . in this case , from being in a similar position to your friend , the best way you can be supportive is continue with your normal friendship . the thing we hate most is being labelled a survivor because what we want most is to be normal like everyone else . traumatic events from childhood do not put your friend in any immediate danger , so not speaking out is not personally harmful . last year i found out i have ptsd from my childhood . i started seeing a therapist and during my intake appointment , my childhood came up . having to retell some of the stories was really , really hard . for a few days after that intake appointment , the memories would surface uncontrollably and i once cried publicly . the therapist also confirmed it was not necessary to talk about that trauma to help me with the behaviors i originally came to solve . sometimes there is no meaning to be found in reliving life experiences that only bring pain . a lot of times , the most helpful thing you can do in a friendship , or any relationship , is just listen . you have acknowledged to your friend that you are there for them . but there is nothing more you can or should do . listening and not losing your calmness and giving a sense of normalcy is what support is . you are a good friend for being supportive . the only other thing i can tell you is you might want to see a therapist yourself to get a medical professional s advice about how you can best help your friend . i hope this helps <end>"

1200,<start> worthless <end>,"<start> for starters i understand how you feel , i was in a similar position not that long ago . throughout high school i did have depression and anxiety but i did not know i had it , therefore throughout high school i had poor grades , poor enough that i actually ended up graduating with a . gap and no awards , no recognitions , no nothing , and then i failed my first year of college . throughout this entire time my family as well was disappointed in me , i was quite literally a loser , bad grades , no friends , no so , nothing . it was not until i was that i met people i could really call friends , which is honestly all i had for a while . i had a so during my first year of college , and because she made me happy , i feared my depression would return so i fear her leaving every day , then i find out i am moving to another state , which them meant id either have to make long distance work or end the relationship , then came the news that i was failing my classes , and soon after my of and i broke up for other reasons , ironically that day i was going to tell her i was moving , but i was shook by the breakup that nothing else came to mind , my final grades came in and i failed three of five classes , so here i am hanging on by a strand , with nothing left . i decided that now that i had nothing , i was going to use this move to make something out of myself , so i picked up new habits , got rid of old habits , and those friends i met at years old , we are all still really close even after i moved , they still talk to me and some have even come visit me , them my grades made a huge improvement when i started at the new school , and now i am a year away from graduating college with a . gap . i understand that things are hard for you right now , but if i , some kid from nowhere who was the definition of a loser , could turn his life around , i believe anyone can , after all , we are still alive so there is still time to turn things around <end>"

1235,<start> i am afraid to get a therapist because i am a very shitty person . <end>,"<start> the important thing is that you are self aware and that automatically puts you far ahead of all the truly shitty people out there . you want help even if you do not think you deserve it and to me , that says that there is hope for you becoming less shitty . x b therapists will recognize this and honestly they will respect it . people who admit they need to change are far easier to work with than people who do not think they have anything to change . you clearly fall in the former camp . x b we all do things that are selfish or unfair . shitty people either do not recognize these things or they rationalize them as positives . you are not a shitty person , and any therapist worth having would not think so either . x b get yourself a therapist and start yourself on the road to becoming the person you want to be . <end>"

sometimes i can implement those strategies for days , even a week or two , but when i fall its so hard to get up again . <end>","<start> keep at it . your depression , like mine , was years and years in the making and reinforcing . the strategy i took is unique . after about decade of outside help , i asked myself , doing what i am doing , am i getting the results i want to get at this point in my life i was barely making money , catering to every whim of an ogre narcissist , and on the verge of failing to pay my bills and rent , and would lose custody of my kids with no residence . my kids were no the ogre s kids . the ogre almost dumped me of at an er to be committed for a suicidal breakdown once already , but chickened out because he would not get access to my child support money any more . the medicine made me feel jitter and jumpy and caused a racing heart at regular doses , so i was reduced to a bare minimum dose , so i do not think the drug manage my depression much . therapy was a place i went to and he or she let me talk . i felt like of the therapy was what i would say to the mirror after reading a self help article of better homes and gardens . i have a ba in psychology . i decided to add real begin science to my anti depression crusade . i experienced my depression setting up camp in my brain as a year old child , with a fairly simple life of school , a pet hermit crab , and little else . no friends a single toddler sibling , and hand off , detachment parents . i remember distinctly the automatic negative thoughts coming from the back rear of my head . the part of my head the tried in vein to counter the ants was the front part , the prefrontal cortex , as i much later learned . the back and front were at war . every night , i would sob in seething pain of hating to be alive and in shame and seeing guilt of feeling the way i felt . i hid it from my parents , although it was not hard . my mental picture of it all was like that of the last judgement with the horrors of hell at the bottom and the goodness of jesus and even up top , like the back bottom of my head and front top of my head . fast forward to my mid s and being on the bring of committed to an institution . i knew from my experience as a child , that the depression had a source in the brain . i looked at brain anatomy and best i can i identify , it is from the area of the limbic system and dorsal raphe nucleus . ls and don it was like the ls has a megaphone in my head and the pfc whispered . or , as if in the war in my head , the ls had rocket loungers and m s and the pfc had bb guns . total imbalance . so , as i explained , i sought out to balance the volume of the ls and pfc . from my classes in college , i k ew about neurons , a bit about how they fire in sequence and wire together and how muscle memory can trigger reflexive firing , luke when we tire our shoes . with repetition , executing the action of tying our shoes does not require the step by step thought process . turns out , it takes a certain number of hours of specific practice to get a certain chain of neuron to wire together . i . hours , you have a pretty good wiring , and with thousands of hours you are considered a professional or a master at something . well , guess how many hours in our lifetime we have spent mastering our depression especially in relation to hours spent on a specific depression counter measure . it is numbers . , , hours is nothing to judge success by when i know my brain has been actively supporting its own depressive habits for thousands of hours since i was years old . so , i took the approach of training like an athlete trains for an upcoming sports season . suppose would be soccer player chris gets some shin guards and soccer shoes , reads up a bit on soccer rules , and practices moves minutes per week in the weeks preceding the first game . suppose would be soccer player pat gets some shin guards , shoes and learns the rules also , but practices every single day . time spent learning to dribble the ball up and down the field , defend around opponent , heading an incoming ball , etc . if pat s total minutes of specific practice on repeating a single move of maneuvering the ball around a cone in practice is a total of minutes a day , times days a week time weeks of pre season , pat has accumulated house of specific practice on that maneuver . who is going to be more ready to perform as a soccer player at the first game the analogy is that i am the would be soccer player and the st game is an looming depressive episode . what i had to to was bring elements of purely objective reality into my anti depressive crusade . x number of minutes doing my in control exercise was one of those objective elements . nothing from my various therapists was ever that kind of specific . it was always well , how do you feel after . . . . how do you feel since . . . how are you feeling . . . . newsflash reporting a feeling is complete subjective . i needed balance in subjective and objective . not all or nothing , just some of each . it turns out , that is the key to overcome g depression , too . balance between the volume and authority of the various areas of our brains . <end>"
1242,<start> meals <end>,"<start> try protein shakes , frozen dinner meals , or things you can make quickly frozen pizza , chicken nuggets tenders , etc . etc . basically , figure out foods you like eating that take the least amount of effort time to make . alternatively , you could even get a slow cooker and look up recipes online . you just put the food in and it cooks all day . v low effort . <end>"
1243,<start> reached the conclusion where death is as meaningless as life <end>,"<start> i can relate , i find myself asking the same question . i have big goals and always try to improve myself , and i recently asked a friend of mine that if i do not reach these goals , what was the point of me living to work for all of it and not finish what i started before i am gone . she responded by saying its the fight i put up to get as far as i did and what i did for my loved ones that counts the most in life , and i think she is right in that , so anytime i question why i am still here i just tell myself how good of a fight i am going to put up in order to achieve my goals and help my loved ones , because life is essentially what one makes of it <end>"

1252,<start> how do you love yourself <end>,"<start> sometimes loving yourself is a lot to ask . i sure do not love myself . tolerating yourself is a great first step . you do not have to walk around thinking your farts do not stink or make lists of the things you like about yourself . step is silencing the voice in your head that tells you all the mean things that make you hate yourself . recognize those thoughts and shut them down before they finish . i read somewhere that the best way to do it is to try your best every day . and your best is different every day , and that is ok . that way when the voice starts up you can always counter it with hey , i am trying my best that is the most you can ask of yourself . try your best and invalidate the voice . step is a bunch of baby steps . what do you want to change about yourself do not make a list . pick the very first thing that pops in your head . and little by little , work to change it . you do not have to fix it in a day . just do your best . then move on to the next thing , but only when you are ready . eventually , maybe you will not love yourself , but you will be more confident and in a better place . <end>"

1364,<start> how do you stop a depression if you feel yourself slipping <end>,"<start> almost everyone with depression goes through phases , be it seasonal or otherwise . for me when i start to feel it come on i will try and distract myself by starting a small project or even cleaning something . if that does not work i will go with something i always love doing like playing with my dog , going for a spontaneous run , finding a hockey game to play in , or even taking my car through some winding back roads for fun . it is all body chemistry and maintaining a good balance of serotonin and dopamine . what you do to fix that balance when it starts to get a little wonky is all personal , and do not get discouraged if something does not work , nothing is perfect . just keep your head up and remember tomorrow is another day . if you have never looked into how depression affects your mind , i highly recommend it . it helped me greatly to find out why i was feeling the way i was and it helped me come up with ways to battle the imbalance then finally decide i needed medication to help me get things straightened out which is something you should never be ashamed of . almost years after an official diagnosis at i am light years above where i started . <end>"

1418,<start> i hate myself so damn much <end>,"<start> first , id like to say that while i also have depression , i do not feel the pain you do , i can only imagine what you are going through . secondly , i want to say that i am no professional but i have done a lot of research and what you are going through is completely normal and its okay to not want to bring up something like that , that is the point of therapy , you slowly ease out information that your therapist retrieves and slowly but surely , a solution will show itself . after all , despite all the pain you feel , you are still here in the world so there is still hope for a solution to present itself , and because you are still here it means you have survived a lot of hardships and gotten back up , so do not give up on yourself <end>"
1419,<start> ink i just feel so fake <end>,"<start> i can relate to your situation , i always attempt to do things the best at what i do , but every time i do i seem to underwhelm myself , and everyone around me seemed to be doing well , getting scholarships , moving out , doing good in school , and they all seem to know themselves pretty well , unlike me , i ask myself questions about me every day really , so while i unfortunately do not really have much advice , i can definitely say you are not alone <end>"

1422,<start> what am i doing wrong <end>,"<start> can relate , and i am not a professional but i have done a lot of research since i struggle with depression as well . detachment is a common symptom of depression , and from the sound of things my theory is that you are functional , but at the cost of being distant , like your mind sees the benefits and costs of certain things subconsciously , it sounds absurd i know but not unlikely if i am being honest . i as well actually have problems with being able to express myself clearly , which is bad because i am a business major so i am doing my best to help this problem and trying to help others as well along the way . and you are heading in the right direction by asking those around you like your significant other but something we got to keeping mind is that they want to help us , they really do , but they are not therapists . and actually that is what therapy is for , so that you can talk as unclear as you want because that might just be a clue to finding a solution for your mental illness , i go to therapy and i literally just unravel there , i tell them the full story because i want to solve my mental illness problem , and the only way for that to happen is if both the doctor and the patient know the full story so that we can get to the source and solve the problem , and from there its just a matter of keeping up with things the therapist tells you and with time things will get better , because we have not given up since we are still here in the world , we are still getting back up after a hit of life so we are not down for the count , and we are not alone , i guarantee there is many more like us out there , part of the reason why this subedit was made in the first place <end>"

1467,<start> how to deal with depressed thoughts and feelings during work <end>,"<start> hey friend glad you can open up to us . just a little unthorough on depression there are top symptoms like feeling bad months and several side symptoms like sleeping issues , eating issues , no motivation i can only recommend you to go to a doctor to talk up your problems for a diagnosis usually they transcribe you to a psychologist for the work issue i can recommend meditation mindfulness to you meditation is not this being connected with the world and it is people thing , rather than a skill used in therapy for ptsd depression and other mental health issues . meditation is there to make you connected with your surroundings and yourself again , it got a wide variety like calming down panic attacks and or calming down the dread bad thoughts many people with depression feel . the best way to learn it might be led meditation , either by checking couture great source material there or the headspace app on android and tunes . i am no advertiser , i am f . patient that uses this app to improve my meditation skill . headspaces basic course is fully free and shows you all you need to know to translate it into your working life . it is basically training your brain to be aware and mindful of what is currently happening around you and calm down your head . if you got any questions feel free to ask away . <end>"

1587,"<start> my depression f sked up my eating , how do i start getting it back <end>","<start> hey there so basically , your stomach has shrunk so much and there is a lot of stomach acid . what i recommend is eat some petto pistol before your meals . petto pistol is a base and will neutralize you stomach acid and make some room for some real food . start off with small meals . eat a ratio of vegetables , meat , and carbs . or if it is really severe , drink some soup . here s a soup recipe i recommend pork soup ingredients ground pork , soy sauce , napa cabbage spinach , water , and rice rice . measure out a cup and wash the rice . just water . no soap . use your hand to swirl the water in the bowl and clean off any dirt on the rice . do not keep washing the rice until the water is clear . it takes the nutrients away from the rice . . measure out the water you use . i generally let the rice sit and use the end to the middle before first knuckle of my pinky finger to measure the amount of water . look on couture if you need help . . cook rice . pot or rice cooker , both work . pot you will need to cover and watch . it will burn if you are not careful . soup . make ground pork balls . smaller less cooking time . . boil water and add veggies . add the pork and some soy sauce . add the soy sauce very scarcely . you can always add more soy sauce later , but you can not subtract it . . wait until the pork floats at the top . . serve and enjoy . take small steps at a time . it will become a bit easier with each meal you eat . best of luck <end>"

1624,<start> my friend suffers from depression <end>,"<start> she is going to continue to struggle until she is willing to do something different , even if it is not going to a therapist or taking medication . the hardest thing about watching someone you love go through this is not being able to fix it for them . all you can do is support her , continue to care about her , and if she asks , offer what you have already offered . she is going to have to be motivated to change . <end>"
1625,<start> would you rather your patient not know they are borderline <end>,"<start> i always tell them if i am confident in that diagnosis . to do differently and treat it as unmentionable is to add to the stigma around bed . if you would discuss a patient having bipolar , but not bed , i think you are protecting your own feelings more than theirs and doing a disservice . <end>"

1627,<start> i have seen two therapists and they both have the same method that is completely unhelpful to me . advice <end>,"<start> i am not going to make a formal assessment of what their guiding theory method is because imo it will be hard to tell based on the info you provided and there is lots of counseling theories methods out there . with that said , it does sound like they are using a strengths based model which for some people would work . however , a good therapist should know that their guiding theory will not work with every client and they should either a try something different or b refer you elsewhere . it does not surprise me that they both use the same method if they are out of the same clinic . personally , for ptsd i have heard emir is amazing you can check out some of the research and my preferred theory is cut because of how structured it can be . ultimately if you are not connecting with your therapist i think it would be best to try another clinic if you can . <end>"
1628,"<start> besides the obvious legal rules , is there any moral or ethical reason a therapist should not smoke cannabis with a patient <end>","<start> everyone reacts differently to cannabis . especially people with anxiety . then again , it would depend on what type you are planning on taking . i am speaking from experience because i have anxiety and all of my psychologists i have been to have been strongly against cannabis use as someone with a mental illness . it all depends on what type of mental illness you have . maybe cod can help , i would not know because i no longer choose to partake in ever trying drugs again . i would rather deal with anxiety on my own than rely on taking a drug overtime i freak out . my sister s husband has slight anxiety when going out in public and takes cod low and he is fine . his anxiety is not enough to need to go therapy for , so he is told me last month . basically , a lot of factors go into it . to answer your actual question in your title , i am assuming most therapists choose not to do so because to be fair , they have studied the mind and behavior more than the average person has and they know more science behind it , especially psychologists who specialize in drug addiction and behavioral health from drugs can not remember the exact name , but my last therapist did this . i guarantee you that most therapists disagree with psychedelic use when they have a patient taking antidepressants antipsychotics benzodiazepines , etc . it is common sense to not take a psychedelic while on those medications . but there is no actual solid answer since everybody is different . it would not be worth the risk though . <end>"

1676,<start> could a therapist please give me guidance on if therapy could even help me in any way and how kinda long <end>,"<start> i think therapy would really help you . that big , overwhelmed feeling , being unhappy , dealing with big time life transitions and illness and recovery , etc . are all the kind of thing that therapy is great for . especially when it is causing strain in relationships . sometimes it is really helpful just to be able to tell someone something without having them judge you or have any emotional reaction about it . it is hard for our family members to do that because all of our feelings are too tied together . if you see a therapist , you will not have to say all of this to them right away . you can just say i feel really overwhelmed and unhappy and it is taking a toll on my marriage and i do not really know what to do . lots of people show up to therapy and barely speak . the therapist will ask you questions and you can talk about whatever comes up for you . as you see them and come to feel more comfortable with them , you can share more . their job is to help you make an overwhelming huge problem into manageable , understandable issues you can deal with . couples counseling might be pretty helpful too . not because your relationship needs work , but going into therapy together might feel pretty empowering for both of you . it could make you feel like you are both on the same team . instead of talking about your contributions vs hers , you could just both talk to the therapist about shared concerns , like how does your current financial situation feel how does it change how you act toward each other what could you do together to fix some of the stuff you are both going through <end>"

1712,<start> how can i find a good therapist <end>,"<start> if you are in america there are a few ways to go about this . i suggest the best way is word of mouth . if you have any friends who see a therapist you could use them as a referral . often therapists schedules will fluctuate whether or not they are taking new clients so it can be tricky . if the therapist is part of a clinic they may refer to another therapist in house . this method may open doors that would otherwise be closed . the only consideration is if the referring friend is a pivotal figure in your life . if so the therapist may consider it a conflict of interest and refer hopefully in house to another therapist . if you have insurance you can call them and they will give you a list of therapists in your network . also , if you are currently working or a dependent of someone who is working they may have employee assistance programs cap which sets a person up with a therapist sessions covered . otherwise , websites like psychologytoday can help you search for therapists and filter for insurance , speciality , and location . lastly , if you are struggling to find someone check out samosa or name . they often have open support groups and you may find one specific to your needs . <end>"
1713,<start> i feel terrible after terminating therapy . why <end>,"<start> because he is still familiar and you probably told him personal things . do not give up on therapy though he just may not be the best fit for your needs . now that you have an idea of what was not working , maybe research therapy styles methods you may like better and call up a few local therapy places to find a therapist that uses those methods and do not be afraid to ask questions <end>"

1716,<start> what is your perspective on people who are mostly fine in therapy <end>,<start> i think everyone should see a therapist wether they have problems or not . sometimes we really just need someone to tell us it is going to be ok . and it matters more coming from someone unbiased and unconnected to us . <end>
1717,<start> can you tell when a client particularly adolescents have a crush on you <end>,"<start> that is definitely happened to me once or twice . i work exclusively with children and teenagers so it can be misplaced attraction due to trauma or simply a hormonal teenager . i would not see it as grounds for terminating the therapy unless the client made advances which luckily has not happened to me or if it was negatively impacting their progress in therapy . it also helps that i have photos of my husband and kids in my office , low . <end>"

1721,<start> what is your opinion <end>,"<start> hey there i am sorry you are feeling so shaken up and upset about this experience . it makes sense that it would spike your anxiety and just generally be really unsettling . i can certainly understand you not wanting to run into people you know in such a vulnerable place . that being said , i would not really expect your therapist to reach out to you before your next appointment to check in on you , based on the events you described . there is a good chance your therapist noticed that you were upset by being confronted by someone you know in the waiting room . however , that is not too uncommon of an occurrence , especially in a smaller town . there is not a whole ton that can be done to prevent people running into someone they know in the waiting room . have you had an appointment with them since the event if so and your therapist did not bring it up , then you will need to be the one to bring it up and figure out if you want to stay with the same therapist from there . if you have not had an appointment since this happened , then i would encourage you to bring it up then . i want to also gently challenge your assumption that your therapist saw that you were upset by bumping into someone in the waiting room . it is very possible that they noticed , but it is also quite possible that they did not . that does not mean they do not care about you , but you may need to be the one to bring it up to them <end>"
1722,"<start> been depressed for years , but i still can not bring myself to do anything about it <end>","<start> sometimes it is much easier to talk to a stranger about how you feel than with a friend . a therapist has no bias for or against you . they are there to listen . and you do not have to worry about revealing too much to a person you socialize with . it is a win win . it sounds like you know the answer to your own question already . go talk to someone . you do not have to tell your friends or family anything about it if you are afraid they might judge you they should not , by the way . if you are in college i would bet that you have access to free or affordable counseling . please take advantage of it and help yourself take care . <end>"

1724,"<start> therapists of reedit , how would you feel or react . . . . <end>","<start> the only ethical response in this case is respectful nonjudgmental curiosity . our clients have reasons for the choices they make , and it is not our job to dissuade them . i would not be repulsed at all , but i would be interested in engaging in dialogue with them about how their lifestyle is meeting their emotional social spiritual needs , and if their current behaviors are aligned with their values and desires . <end>"

1728,<start> help with my adult daughter with complex ptsd . <end>,"<start> i hear your worry , and see that you want to help her . i can not give any sort of specific advice , but love and accept her for who she is . your anxiety may because her more anxiety , or make her think you believe her to be incapable or some other unhelpful thought . it is possible that your care and worry can work against her , without realizing it or intending it . be someone who listens and validates her . acknowledge her challenges , and that chronic illness can be difficult . lots of people start with only socializing online , do not judge it , know that she is doing what is safe for her , and when she feels more confident will branch out . i guess my best advice is be nonjudgmental , loving and supportive . provide acknowledgment and validation for her struggles , and know she is doing her best . she needs to be built up in her confidence , and even your concern or true caring can possibly come off as belief that she is incapable unable . lots of well meaning parents do harm unintentionally . i see you mean well and hope this does not come off harsh . you know she is not lazy , she just needs help therapy is definitely the best first step . also , yoga yoga can be very beneficial for trauma and health reasons <end>"

1737,<start> question male suicide rising <end>,"<start> i am not sure we will ever know a why but only be able to find correlations between subjects . i personally feel from my anecdotal experience that even though some of the stigma has been reduced regarding men coming forward about their emotions , there is also less grey area and more extreme opinions being spread across the media . . . so there are a lot of people who say yes , absolutely men should come forward if they are feeling depressed and have issues to work through and a lot of people saying absolutely not , why in the world can not he just buck up and deal with it and not many people in between . therefore , if someone is seeking therapy , they might be returning to a stigmatizing social group or home life . or , they come from a stigmatizing or radicalized social group and do not try to seek help . the men i have seen who make the most progress in therapy also have an incredible support group outside of their counselor or therapy group , and those who struggle tend to return to their poor habits or unhealthy environments when they leave counseling and feel as though they are not able to find healthier relationships . another important consideration is the methods men and women tend to use to complete suicide . men tend to use more lethal methods gun wounds , hanging , jumping and women tend to use less lethal methods cutting , pills . the generally accepted statistics regarding suicide in the us states that x as many men complete suicide and x as many women attempt suicide . so there are generally the same amount of individuals who have a desire to contemplate suicide but the running theory is that men actually complete more frequently is due to the severity of their attempts . <end>"

1761,<start> is there any clear rules on showing cleavage or skin in your workplace <end>,<start> this would depend on the workplace generally there are not clear rules . <end>
1762,<start> i am not sure what is wrong with me anymore <end>,"<start> i would recommend setting an alarm on your phone to make sure you are taking your medication regularly , this can drastically reduce your symptoms . i know you mentioned that when you took your medication consistently for months , your episodes reduced , so that is a good sign that your medication is helping your symptoms . another good thing to add to your daily routine is moments of mindfulness . you can coordinate this with the time you take your medication as well let your husband or whoever else might interrupt know that you are going to take minutes that need to be uninterrupted . you can sit in a comfortable position , put on some music without words , close your eyes , and focus on how your body feels . focus on the way your bottom feels on the surface your sitting on , your feet or legs on the floor , the weight of your arms , or the weight of your head on your neck . if your mind wanders to the dishes or any concerns , acknowledge the thought but refocus on your senses . i know it sounds kind of hippy but it really helps to connect your brain with your body and you can use those skills over time to calm your mind when you have a feeling of becoming overwhelmed . so when you see those dishes piling up and you start to become anxious , bring yourself back into the present moment and refocus on your body for a moment before deciding how you want to handle the situation . i hope this is helpful if you would like to start going to therapy , there are some therapists who will do therapy out of pocket or offer sliding scale payments which are based on your income . <end>"

1807,"<start> it is good to hear you have good boundaries in other areas of your life that means you have a good gauge for who you feel you can trust with rejection . that might be a good thing for you to consider when you do start seeing someone romantically when you feel your potential romantic partner is crossing a boundary or you should say no , ask yourself if this were friend asking this , would i say no if you would say no to anyone else , say no to them . you have to learn their level of rejection perception and it is not fair for you to assume your partner can not handle rejection and as you have learned , it only reinforces negative behaviors . you can also reflect on the times you said yes when you should have said no and imagine how you could have said no not as an effort to rekindle anything , but as a practice for when you need to say no to a new partner . having a firm schedule is a good way to make sure you are not becoming too clingy or being a people pleaser as well . if you decide to workout from pm on mondays , wednesdays , and thursdays , or you make a plan with a friend , commit to it . if a non emergency comes up and your partner wants to hang out i have to go to the gym , but i can hang out other time . major life events might deviate this schedule , but setting the schedule before you enter a potential partnership and holding true to it through courting and dating is a good way to establish to your partner your boundaries and ensure you have time to remember the things that are important to you . if your potential partner wigs out over this , red flag alert . it can also be helpful to talk to friends about it . let me give you a hypothetical , i hope it is not too obtuse or abstract you decide to meet up for dinner and drinks with a friend you have not seen in a month . your partner texts to hang out instead but you tell them i have plans with jimmy , but i am free tomorrow at partner replies saying , that is really selfish of you , i really just want to spend time with you and you are not here for me , but does not have a legitimate reason no death in the family , they are not ill , etc for you choosing to hang out with partner over your friend who you have had plans with for weeks . you choose to hang out with your friend because you promised yourself you would not cancel your plans . at dinner , you mention that your partner got upset when you chose to hang out with jimmy instead of partner . how does jimmy react he may say , what a load of horseshit , throwaways , partner has no reason to be upset , we have had these plans for weeks then you have some confirmation that this is a red flag alert and can open the conversation with your partner about how their behavior crossed a boundary for you . you could always go to some psychoanalyst and learn that when you were a child you saw your parents do x , y , and z and that is why you are having problems with boundaries in romantic relationships , but is that knowledge going to do anything for you it may be helpful to see a therapist regardless i think everyone benefits from therapy , even when people use it as a preventative measure but try not to get stuck on the why but focus on the how and what how can i improve boundary setting in romantic relationships and what can i do differently next time <end>","<start> i have to say that your responses are really insightful , thank you x b i might add that in this last relationship . to begin with , i was not the one dealing with unacceptable behaviour . i was the one acting out a little bit over small stuff , because i was afraid that it was a sign of her backing off . but as the relationship grew more complicated , i was the one that was left accepting a situation that was just bad for me . x b i had a similar realization to the one i have had now with my second relationship that ended . i realized that i really had to love myself , as corny as it sounds , in order to set these boundaries . in order to prioritize myself when so that i am never too clingy or needy , but also so that when a situation occurs when i need to put my foot down , it will come natural to me . x b but i guess something happened a long the way . this was more than a year ago . i am guessing that it might have to do with me using casual partners , tinder and dating in general as a way of coping with being single . i have always heard people say get a rebound go on and date casually , basically sleep around until you are sick of it . i would not say that i was destructive in any way , but maybe it altered my focus a little too much . x b it makes sense that maybe i was just using something other than a relationship in order to deal with whatever insecurities and esteem issues that i was experiencing . x b do you have any idea of what type of practical activities i could engage in in order to help cultivate a healthier relationship towards myself <end>"
1808,"<start> i have to say that your responses are really insightful , thank you x b i might add that in this last relationship . to begin with , i was not the one dealing with unacceptable behaviour . i was the one acting out a little bit over small stuff , because i was afraid that it was a sign of her backing off . but as the relationship grew more complicated , i was the one that was left accepting a situation that was just bad for me . x b i had a similar realization to the one i have had now with my second relationship that ended . i realized that i really had to love myself , as corny as it sounds , in order to set these boundaries . in order to prioritize myself when so that i am never too clingy or needy , but also so that when a situation occurs when i need to put my foot down , it will come natural to me . x b but i guess something happened a long the way . this was more than a year ago . i am guessing that it might have to do with me using casual partners , tinder and dating in general as a way of coping with being single . i have always heard people say get a rebound go on and date casually , basically sleep around until you are sick of it . i would not say that i was destructive in any way , but maybe it altered my focus a little too much . x b it makes sense that maybe i was just using something other than a relationship in order to deal with whatever insecurities and esteem issues that i was experiencing . x b do you have any idea of what type of practical activities i could engage in in order to help cultivate a healthier relationship towards myself <end>","<start> as far as practical activities to better your self esteem . . . here s some that i like for every one negative thing you think about yourself , think of more that you like . anything from waking up in the morning and looking in the mirror and think wow , the bags under my eyes are terrible today , to feeling down about your performance at work . combat every negative thought about yourself with good thoughts . if you can not shake the negative thought , think about if it is something you are able to change . you mentioned you go to the gym , so if it is a body image concern , commit to going more frequently or looking up healthy workout and diet plans . if you have the money , see a nutritionist or trainer to tailor a workout and diet plan that fits your goals . take some time every day to be mindful . that could be meditation , or even just admiring nature . do not time yourself , and set an alarm if you have something to do at a particular time so you do not get lost in the moment . enjoying life and the people and things around me has greatly increased my own quality of life . do you have any hobbies i can not recall at the moment , but there is a sub for inexpensive free hobbies . you can always try something new , of course being aware that you are not going to be great right away , but it can feel good to cultivate a skill . <end>"

1818,<start> is it weird that my therapist has not mentioned her recent divorce <end>,"<start> and now you see one of the problems when a therapist speaks casually about their life to a client . in my humble professional opinion aspects of a therapist life should only be shared to illustrate a therapeutic point or to help create an empathic bond . it is not weird that she is not mentioning her divorce , it is weird she casual talked to you about her life in the first place . <end>"

1820,<start> is it possible to become worse or just more aware <end>,"<start> i am glad that you recognize you are becoming more aware yes , things will feel worse while rediscovering feelings that have been numbed out . think of all the unfelt feelings that are rushing in . like when a dam releases water . make sure you have established coping and relaxation skills to help you through , people to call and an emergency plan in case things get too difficult . you are on the right track , keep it up <end>"
1821,<start> any tips for working on overcoming feelings of dissatisfaction with my life <end>,"<start> there could be many reasons for this i think , but you could start by asking yourself what it means to grow as a person why is that valuable what feeling are you seeking and how would growing provide it have you felt it in the past when and why <end>"

1825,<start> i feel like nobody in my life actually cares about me <end>,<start> i am no therapist but maybe get involved with something depending on your age you can probably find some fun stuff and meet people near you . maybe volunteer at a zoo if animals are your thing . maybe find a trivia night club and go and see if any teams are willing to let you join . if your in school maybe go outside your comfort zone and join some clubs even though it is the end of the school year for most . hell if you were near me i would ask you to hang . i am sure there is a lot of people in your vicinity that would care to ask you about your day or go get lunch with . you just got to find em can you bond over anything with your family do a game night with fam friends maybe host a movie marathon i am just spiralling here . sorry if none of this helps you with what your looking for . <end>
1826,<start> is there someone here that i can talk to in the pms about a problem <end>,"<start> my guess is , it would be easier to find someone in this sub if they knew what the actual problem is . i am not talking about details , just a general subject of what you are dealing with . hopefully you will meet someone that will help you . good luck <end>"
1827,<start> help me help my wife . <end>,"<start> keep an eye on yourself , it sounds like she holds you responsible for her mental health and it sounds like you accept that , and may be getting seduced into fixing her . those are treacherous waters . take care of yourself . <end>"
1828,<start> how to overcome transference <end>,"<start> hopefully your therapist is trained and experienced enough to explore with you the meaning of this transference . you can also help yourself work through the transference by recognizing so much of it is driven by the supportive nature of the therapeutic relationship with no demands being placed upon you to do anything to support this relationship . but recognize that the relationship is profoundly one sided . a friendship is not one sided . a friendship with your former therapist , if such a thing was ethically possible , would be very different from your therapeutic relationship . it would naturally demand support and accommodation by you towards your former therapist as any friendship would demand . in such a friendship you would have a completely different experience of your therapist . in fact you might discover that you do not even like your therapist as a friend <end>"
1829,<start> does my room mate have psychosis <end>,"<start> well , it certainly seems like things are outside of normal limits here the source of this woman could be from stress , extreme fatigue , psychosis or did . the fact that she says this woman moves items in her room is very concerning . <end>"
1830,<start> is this the right subedit to ask questions about your own behavior <end>,"<start> i believe so this is a relatively small sub and not intended to replace the use of a therapist , however , i think it is a good place to start if you would like to make some minor modifications and it is not severe to the point of seeking therapy . and if any of your problems seem to be something out of the range of advice from a therapist , it seems like members will let you know that therapy might be a better option . <end>"

1834,<start> how to be more motivated amp better at decision making <end>,"<start> it sounds like a lot of different issues have snowballed and blended into a tangled mess of generally feeling unhappy . from what you have said , you did not get to spend a lot of time as a child adolescent getting to know who you are . you have always been working and taking on very grown up roles . i am also hearing a lot of internalized pressure . it sounds as though you believe every time you make it over the next hurdle you will find happiness . it does not sound like you have a balanced life . think of your life like slices of a pie , with equal amounts of energy going to each slice . you need slices for work , friendship , love , spirituality , hobbies . spend some time getting to know who you are outside of work and academics . figure out what is fun to you . start talking back to these negative voices in your head . this is where therapy can truly help . it may also help in addressing some of the childhood experiences that are likely the root of those negative messages . do better with self care , including adding some pleasure in your life . good luck to you <end>"

1836,<start> thank you so much for the advice . how would i take time outside of work to think when making money is also so important <end>,"<start> money is important but what we know about happiness is that money can only help if the person already has some level of happiness and satisfaction to start . in other words , if you are in the middle of a divorce , you just moved to a new town where you know no one and your cat just died money is not likely to help much . if your life is simply about money and the job that brings it does not bring you joy , then what is the point it is cliche because it is true . . . no one says on their death bed they wish they had worked more . <end>"
1837,<start> is this a problem or is everyone just different <end>,"<start> anger is considered a secondary emotion . like , no one is ever just angry , they are hurt and angry , or frustrated and angry , or scared and angry , etc , etc . people , sometimes especially men depending on their parents , get the message that anger is normal expected but other emotions are not , so a lot of emotions get absorbed into and covered with anger . i sort of agree with the other poster who said if it is not causing problems , it is not a problem , but i also know that men who are able to articulate a wider range of emotions typically have more satisfying relationships . it sounds like you have curiosity about it , and asking an actual therapist about it could give you a better idea of what is going on for you with it . <end>"
1838,<start> i want to bang my therapist <end>,"<start> yes , talk about them to the extent that you can . it is understandably awkward and uncomfortable . it will also probably feel like an elephant in the room and will not go away until you acknowledge it . as you have read , it is a normal and common response to therapy . if your therapist felt the need to refer you elsewhere over this , then she is not a good therapist . upping your frequency is something to discuss , though if you feel you have more material you need to start addressing which sounds like it could be the case , then seeing her more often would make sense . if you are unsure how to start talking about it , you could always use hypotheticals what would you do if a client said x or a bit of preparation there is something on my mind that i would like to talk about but i am concerned about your response . both of these might give you a little information about how she could handle it and then you have more knowledge about how you would feel most comfortable proceeding . <end>"

1840,<start> i like this idea . i will start thinking of some hypotheticals i could use to broach the subject . <end>,"<start> what this commenter said is good advice also you may want to wait and work through your feelings of transference before deciding to go more frequently , that way you are sure your intentions are for your self betterment rather than going more frequently because of your attraction to her . <end>"
1841,<start> how can i f stop taking my spouse m for granted <end>,"<start> do you know your partner feels that way or are you assuming they feel that way i would say first and foremost , have a conversation with your partner regarding your perception of it and then leave lots of time and space to hear his point of view . also , know that every interaction in your relationship is part of reciprocal partnership . while it is great that you have the hindsight that you would like to make this change , there are likely changes that he can also be making to support you . <end>"

1846,"<start> therapist shouting stuff during one session , suggests crazy things , inpatient , etc . <end>","<start> i would move on and find someone else . this therapist sounds a little too paranoid . suicidal ideology admissions by a client can be tough to deal with i would imagine , but the last thing you need is someone yelling at you if you have those kinds of thoughts . i admitted to my therapist that i was suicidal , and even details about what i would do . she saw this as a brave admission and a reach out for help . it was after the fact , and i did not obviously go through with it . she did , in a very calm way , ensure that i had no current plans of self harm and was very supportive and compassionate . i would suggest you take the time to interview your next therapist before committing to work with them . all them how they handle these kinds of things and tell them about this experience and how it made you feel . you deserve someone who you can be real with , even if it is stuff like this without getting the shit scared out of you for it . <end>"
1847,<start> what are my options <end>,"<start> the therapist may not be comfortable going forward with couples therapy if your husband himself needs more attention specifically to his symptoms or if he feels it is out of his competence but definitely ask the therapist and he should honestly let you know why . as to your question about specific therapies , cognitive behavioral therapy known as cut is one of the most evidence based and effective forms of therapy used for ptsd i would consider looking for a therapist who specializes in cut . rational emotive behavioral therapy rest has shown good outcomes with ptsd but it can be intense . another good thing to remember is that a person has to be ready and willing to change his behavior . <end>"

1865,<start> how do i know what is normal and what is neglect trauma <end>,"<start> i have almost the exact same problem . halfway through what i think is a funny story i realize that people look horrified and i immediately get self conscious and want to sink into the floor . if i play it off as a joke , it kinda works but the awkward chuckles betray the lack of humor . i have found that a quick mental run through of the story helps decide whether it would be appropriate . if there any details involving parents not behaving as model citizens either edit them out or just do not tell the story . feels like censoring yourself but it saves you from the pitying looks that i , at least , despise . <end>"
1866,<start> should i tell my therapist of my drug use <end>,"<start> yes i am almost a therapist and i would find it really helpful if my client told me that . telling them does not mean that you are problems are focused on drugs , but it does mean drug use is how you are coping right now . the more a therapist can learn about you and what your life is like outside the session , the better things will be and the more they will be able to help you . <end>"

1874,<start> i am finding it difficult to make a decision about marrying my boyfriend <end>,"<start> you can not let anybody s opinions or ideas stop you from pursuing what you love . if you are happy with him then you should take a chance and go for him . do not listen to what others say if you think they are just acting this way because of economic , political , or social views . they can not tell you who you can or can not love and if they try to stop you then clearly they do not want you to be happy . though if your family is right and they think he is not good for you is a bad influence then they could possibly be right and looking out for you . honestly this is your decision nobody can make it for you and its not something you can take in to consideration lightly . do what you think is right . if you truly love him more then anything then why not take a chance on love if things do not work out then you always have family to help you out if they really care for your well being that is . <end>"

1894,<start> mandated reporter question <end>,<start> i think that the therapist was trying to be clear and transparent . by letting you know what information is required for a report they are giving you the option to share as much or as little detail as you feel comfortable with . therapists are not detectives looking to solve crimes . we are here to help keep people safe . <end>

1946,<start> conflict of interest <end>,"<start> if the person doing providing your therapy is not a licensed therapist , licensed by your state province country , they are not really held to any ethical standards and can do anything they want . they are not required to disclose anything to you or even really keep what you say confidential . if they are a therapist licensed by your state licensing board , they are not able to do this kind of thing as they are held to a code of ethics and are subject to certain laws regarding confidentiality and dual relationships . in most cases , therapists will not see two members of the same family . the only exception is if you live in an area where it would be an undue burden for them to find another therapist say the only other therapist that takes their insurance is or more miles away . in cases where a client does see a family member , they are never allowed to disclose information about past clients or that they even know who they are without written consent . my guess is that your sister mother s therapist never even said that to your mother and she made it up . if your therapist is aware ahead of time that your mother may try to do this and they recognize her name , if they are ethical , and also licensed held to an ethical code they will not see her and will refer her to someone else . if by chance they started seeing her and only found out later , they would most likely decide to drop her as they took her after you unless you were about done with therapy , but once again , only if they are a licensed therapist . <end>"

1978,<start> help <end>,"<start> not a therapist , but here s my uneducated opinion without knowing the type of abuse or who you as a person . this will probably be bad advise because i am not educated and i do not know the situation . x b if i was you , i probably have already learned how to partition your personalities . keeping the hurt and fear away from the public and only showing the happy and carefree . x b use that . when you are feeling like less than worth existing , use it to treat yourself to an experience that you think someone you may think is better than you . masquerade as an amazing person with an interesting life . use your ability to create happiness and portray joy to show yourself what it looks like . instead of using it to perform for others , perform only for yourself . if you do not feel the motivation to perform or you feel that you are not worthy of the performance . . then practice for the big show . practice for when you feel like you are worth it . practice it until you are a professional at being happy and carefree . x b i would first try getting a gourmet meal at a star fine dining restaurant . order the special . let yourself enjoy it . do not let others looks discourage yourself . you are there to show yourself that you are the strong and powerful person that is able to eat alone in public and you are not concerning yourself about a strangers opinion . i would maybe try making a sand castle , if you are near a beach , or a mud castle if you are near the forest . this would help me have a fun and interesting project that is just for me . knowing it will just be washed away by the next high tide or heavy rain . i can do anything i want and not worry about it being judged . i would make a castle that i would love to picture how it would be used by a society . i would image i am the royalty , or member of the court , or a servant . . . any of them that would be fine , i would be chronically the scandals and secrets and odd interactions because i am the only one above all of them and i am able to view their network of whispers in their fullness . i would try to say hello to a stranger , maybe a smile . especially an older person that may be at the end of a long day or a person that i pass in the store . not for anything but knowing that people tend to smile back or get a moment of subconscious joy when someone smiles or says hi to them . i would know that i am bringing positivity to others just by catching their attention with a smile , a hi , or a thank you . that is pretty much just existing . by just existing i am bringing joy to others . acknowledge that , keep it close to your heart , let yourself believe it . volunteer at a pet shelter . wash a dog , walk a dog , let the dogs know you will be back to give them a good scratch . learn how you can volunteer with training them or posting media online or offline to help them get adopted . x b lastly , but should really be first , consult a therapist professional . x b i hope this helps and or inspires something helpful in you <end>"

1996,<start> adult babies <end>,"<start> there is a book by michael bent that talks about this in lots of detail . personally , i think it can be both a general interest intrigue as well as a way of coping . i do not really have any concern with it so long as it is not hurting anybody . <end>"
1999,<start> should i see a different therapist <end>,"<start> therapist here . we are legally bound to report any instance of suspected potential child abuse or neglect . her delivery was off and she could have brought up the issue about her legal obligation to report such things in a very different way . it would have been better if she helped you through the crisis first , then discussed the cps reporting afterwards . she can not be validating towards actions that are unhealthy for you and your children , but she should been validating that you were in distress and your feelings , so i would not say this is a case of tough love in that sense . <end>"
2002,"<start> this is an excellent response . kids are often used as pawns , but know that if you start going to extreme legal means , you will also be using him as a pawn . he misses her , he is telling you that . mom is not able to give him the love he needs from her , and you can not change that . give him instead what you can . be the safe loving mother she can not be , and know that he will always wish he had more from her . therapy can help him make meaning of his experiences . she likely loves him as best she can , and as long as she is good enough as protective services define a parent that can keep their children , children who are free from harm and abuse then her best is going to have to be enough . <end>","<start> this . having gone through this an a similar situation , you need to learn to let go after a while . an emotionally abusive mother is just that , and while it is absolutely heartbreaking to have to witness , there really is not much that you can do . you can not fix the other parent , and chances are you can not fix the situation because it is very , very hard to prove . the mother is unavailable because the child is her source of validation . is it awful yes . can you prove it doubtful . will the child be okay probably . i cannot stress enough that the most important thing you can do is learn to let go . do not fixate . you cannot change the circumstances he is in there . trust me . but you can show him real love , you can show him stability , you can show him happiness . my best advice having been in your shoes is for dad to be the best damned dad he can be , and you to be the best stereom you can be . you will not , can not and should not replace mom . but you can be an ally , you can be a friend , you can be a positive maternal figure . and in the end , it will act as a balance to the less than perfect situation he has there . stay out of it . do not mention his mom . just love and support him in those moments . you can be frustrated and upset when you see this happen , which you will be because you love this child . but that is your burden , and it needs to stay with you . just focus on yourself , your home , and the life you build with him when he is there . accept what you can not fix and trust what you can give . <end>"

2055,<start> how can i make objective observations of myself if all i ever feel about myself is self doubt <end>,"<start> therapy would be really helpful here , and i am glad you are considering it . one technique that comes to mind is cut , which you can actually look at online particularly cognitive restructuring which is basically challenging your negative thoughts about yourself to more realistic ones . self doubt is totally natural , but it does become unhealthy when it is impacting your mood and your self esteem . the other thing you could try is journaling , or keeping a notebook . one option is writing down your feelings journaling is seriously good therapy . the other idea is writing down what you did well . what are the things you are proud of today what are the things that can book future self doubt on the head it might feel weird at first , but getting yourself into that pattern and seeing things on paper can make a world of difference . good luck . <end>"

2067,<start> they are actually the same thing . you had a panic attack which is the formal name given to an experience of overwhelming anxiety . <end>,"<start> this unvoted . op , from what you are saying , certainly sounds like it . a panic attack has nothing to do with overreacting . by the time anyone has a panic attack , it is completely out of their control . essentially what happens is that all of your adrenaline gets dumped into your bloodstream at once . once this happens , all you can try to do is use coping skills to make yourself as comfortable as you can until it passes . no matter how bad , it will always pass with time because the adrenaline does not stay effective for very long and most folks bodies do not produce it quickly enough to keep it pumping for long once you have used up all your stores . you can not prevent or stop it once it is started , however you can take steps to make sure you do not get to that point beforehand and make plans so you know exactly what to do to make yourself as comfortable as possible if when it happens . <end>"
2068,<start> too clingy instant attachment <end>,"<start> i think it is a bit hard to give a reason without knowing more about you nothing is ever clear cut . yes , attachment plays a big part with our families being key in forming those patterns . yet there is a big spectrum of healthy . you may have had normal parents , but still managed to pick up on different behaviours or patterns . attachment can also be shaped from later in life like the relationships with students , teachers etc , the way we think , feel and the environment that we grow up in . maybe it is worth getting curious about what sort of stuff runs through your mind when you feel like your getting clingy and trying to change things that way . . <end>"

once again , thank you . your words showed me a path i probably never knew i had . this is a first , hearing that i may have depression . <end>","<start> hello relikgrey , thank you so much for your great , open replies , they are so helpful and an honor to read . i agree with turkoman that you have definitely experienced several traumas and you are right , the interesting thing about healing ourselves is that often , the first steps are realizing and having others support us that there is in fact something to heal . again , your choice to recognize that even if it was not a rational act it is often a bigger intelligence which we have to listen to which i call our existential spiritual intuitive . that deep intelligence we do not even have to understand but we have to choose to listen it is pushing us to heal , to reach out for support , to open up even when we do not feel like it , we resist healing , or we feel too closed to let others in somehow , we make the choice and that makes us true heroes because this is the path to love and a full life what every human needs and most wants , covered up by the pain and our ego fear false independence desire for control . x b your description of your experiences of trauma can be seen in many things , some but not all of them you described were being beaten the sudden change of country and being completely unable to integrate for a couple of years due to language barrier the attempt to expose your vulnerable and beautiful courage to write a girl you liked by a friend who either was just curious or possibly lacked emotional maturity and so , some sensitivity and respect for your boundaries we all have to learn and grow and forgive others for what we are , too just imperfect humans . in addition , being an adolescent is a very big growth and challenging phase adding your relocation of culture , not just of home , as well as losing the continuous presence of your father are all real stress loads that can add to our trauma response . please see next reply for my own mini story of being traumatized over a series of years built up by several life events simply the atmosphere of my family that accumulated over time as another example for you to reference if it might help you x b a note here being adolescent boys , they often are following their egos fear and insecurity masked by an attempt to control instead of open up and love so they bully themselves and others into covering up the most beautiful parts of themselves their vulnerabilities , needs , and tender emotions i am sorry that happened to you , and is very common emotional bullying towards boys . mostly , boys with strong emotional spiritual intelligence and critical thinking can see through the fake versions of masculinity and resist the pressure to shut down their feelings , and know that their sensitivity and vulnerability are what make them most capable of love and fulfillment . x b when you talk about not being able to feel anything but some physical sensations instead of emotions now , and maybe a bit of tenderness and a bit of anger , you make me think of a condition called anepithymia which means the inability to have words for feelings , and the feeling of not experiencing emotions , but rather , bodily sensations , or having a very limited range of emotions anger sexual feelings , for example . and this is very common among males through the socialization process . boys are officially trained and bullied to not maintain their natural , inborn emotional intelligence , and pressured to display false control

to stop even feeling , their own tender , beautiful , vulnerable emotions and that means they lose contact with even what is happening except to feel anger or sexual drive . sexual drive is designed to be connected to the heart and our deep human natural need for connection bonding and intimacy , it is not a physical act . anger is not ever really only anger it is most often a secondary emotion which means , it is a defensive emotion that arrives to try to protect us from something more real like sadness , embarrassment , shame , fear , guilt , etc . if we let anger be a messenger hi , anger what are you here to teach me and not a leader i feel angry , therefore i stay defensive and act on it then it can serve us because we can understand and choose how to use it often , that means either to set a healthy boundary i get angry because someone does not respect my emotional or physical safety , or to express an underlying vulnerability i get angry , i slow down , breathe , take a break and reflect and realize i am sad and scared , and i allow that , do not cover it up , do not lash out in anger , and choose to share those feelings with the person i trust , and have empathy and compassion for myself and accept them as part of my being an emotionally healthy , strong human being who is committed to growth and health . x b feeling agitated or annoyed by dumb or loud people listen to jason gaddis about emotionally unavailable man and toxic masculinity because he talks about how when he was not in his own heart , everything annoyed him . i can say that for myself , not being a man , i also have that happen when i am depressed or just not taking good care of myself . i get easily annoyed and my lovely sensitivity becomes a burden because my nervous system is maxed out . you can read online or books about sensitivity and what a gift it is elaine aaron is wonderful and the author , also has online tests but , like a ferrary , you have to know how to take care of

through something as simple as a genuine smile of appreciation for a gesture of your dad s love in cooking for you , or happiness for your mom s special occasion , that is where your deep soul is crying out to be freed from the she will of ego . that is your natural , true , loving nature you were born with . it is your health calling you into a new vision for yourself . it is asking you , i believe , to choose growth and love as your path . those are the choices that lead to happiness . you can choose love , and choose growth . x b sometimes , instead , we have an emergency and we need

which means anything that negatively significantly impacts and blocks our abilities to cope and thrive and shuts us down or makes us resort to emergency , more short term coping skills that are not

2109,"<start> hello relikgrey , thank you so much for your great , open replies , they are so helpful and an honor to read . i agree with turkoman that you have definitely experienced several traumas and you are right , the interesting thing about healing ourselves is that often , the first steps are realizing and having others support us that there is in fact something to heal . again , your choice to recognize that even if it was not a rational act it is often a bigger intelligence which we have to listen to which i call our existential spiritual intuitive . that deep intelligence we do not even have to understand but we have to choose to listen it is pushing us to heal , to reach out for support , to open up even when we do not feel like it , we resist healing , or we feel too closed to let others in somehow , we make the choice and that makes us true heroes because this is the path to love and a full life what every human needs and most wants , covered up by the pain and our ego fear false independence desire for control . x b your description of your experiences of trauma can be seen in many things , some but not all of them you described were being beaten the sudden change of country and being completely unable to integrate for a couple of years due to language barrier the attempt to expose your vulnerable and beautiful courage to write a girl you liked by a friend who either was just curious or possibly lacked emotional maturity and so , some sensitivity and respect for your boundaries we all have to learn and grow and forgive others for what we are , too just imperfect humans . in addition , being an adolescent is a very big growth and challenging phase adding your relocation of culture , not just of home , as well as losing the continuous presence of your father are all real stress loads that can add to our trauma response . please see next reply for my own mini story of being traumatized over a series of years built up by several life events simply the atmosphere of my family that accumulated over time as another example for you to reference if it might help you x b a note here being adolescent boys , they often are following their egos fear and insecurity masked by an attempt to control instead of open up and love so they bully themselves and others into covering up the most beautiful parts of themselves their vulnerabilities , needs , and tender emotions i am sorry that happened to you , and is very common emotional bullying towards boys . mostly , boys with strong emotional spiritual intelligence and critical thinking can see through the fake versions of masculinity and resist the pressure to shut down their feelings , and know that their sensitivity and vulnerability are what make them most capable of love and fulfillment . x b when you talk about not being able to feel anything but some physical sensations instead of emotions now , and maybe a bit of tenderness and a bit of anger , you make me think of a condition called anepithymia which means the inability to have words for feelings , and the feeling of not experiencing emotions , but rather , bodily sensations , or having a very limited range of emotions anger sexual feelings , for example . and this is very common among males through the socialization process . boys are officially trained and bullied to not maintain their natural , inborn emotional intelligence , and pressured to display false control toward others aggression like in the fights you mentioned and even the sparring in martial arts with your friend , and toward themselves covering up denying and then eventually , training themselves to stop even feeling , their own tender , beautiful , vulnerable emotions and that means they lose contact with even what is happening except to feel anger or sexual drive . sexual drive is designed to be connected to the heart and our deep human natural need for connection bonding and intimacy , it is not a physical act . anger is

of the anti ego squad on the planet <end>","<start> my trauma history reply to your thoughts about therapists i had a clear symptom of a history of trauma that built up but did not appear until i was . and at the time , neither i nor anyone in my family still recognized it . before this my parents had divorced when i was , and my mom remarried when i was , we changed religions not drastically , but this still represented a break with family tradition and security . my mom and stepped were not in any way abusive or actively hurting me , and yet , there was a constant level of stress in strain in their relationship very critical , negative , and always arguing , but not yelling , my mom had depression we did not know it at the time , but now it makes sense so was extra critical and negative all the time picking apart what we did and very rarely having a kind or encouraging interaction or warmth , and my dad , who was much more emotionally healthy and warm , was far away in another state and we saw him only a couple of times a year . i did not know or feel it consciously at the time until much later as an adult , when i started to cry and grieve this period , but i was living in a bit of an emotional desert , being very sensitive and affectionate but not having much warmth , intimacy , or simply positive interaction with the family around me . i spent time with my dog , nature god , and my best friend . and then we moved houses not once but twice , and finally , moved states not once but twice . my dad stayed in my life this whole time , but by the time we moved the last time , it was too much for my sensitive system . it is like i ran out of inner happy fuel the fuel i had built up from my happy early childhood , my connection with my dad , and surviving by spending time with my dog nature god and my best girl friend before our move . so , i had a bit of an identity crisis . i was a junior in high school and had to start completely over no friends , no support system , and a completely different culture much less dramatic than yours , so just have empathy for how stressful yours was for your system in the sense of a different social cultural area of the united states , and that was a big deal , because it made me see myself differently and feel insecure and i had no best friend left her behind with the move to give me a sense of my secure world . i am also an introvert , so i do not need a lot of friends , but i do need them , and it makes it hard for me to open up and feel comfortable in busy group situations which all means , it makes it hard to meet new people in a new big school . add to this i was starting to question our new religion which was the other rock in my family s life and it all was too much . i became depressed for the first time in my life i stopped taking good care of my grooming , of my room , i lost motivation to do homework i was an excellent student up until then and never had moodiness that interfered with my life , and though i thought i was generally happy , i was , i also had a low level of melancholy and wanted to kind of withdraw too much , not going outside or just feeling at ease in life in my down time . the time i finally began recognizing the trauma i am continuing to learn from it and use it to heal myself and others i seemed to recover by the time i graduated high school , and went on to college , but my sense of angst and depression just came back because moving away to college , facing a whole new culture there , and being separated from home and my dog my best friend , very real and family , were all lots of stressors i was not ready for , and my big religious questions , combined with my lack of emotional nurturing at home over the years , and i went to therapy for the first time . the therapist who interviewed me first was terrible , but he luckily referred me to a wonderful doctor , named dr . smart who was warm , gentle , kind , and an amazing , quiet and soft listener . this is what i needed , and , with a small group of gentle and kind friends , i grew healthier and also found a wonderful support in the university department i chose to study in art in a couple of gentle and loving professors . where was the trauma it was small , slow , and mostly built of neglect what was missing , not what was actively done . and then , small chronic mini stressors that , built up over years , are trauma , because they ask an overload of effort on the emotional spiritual system to survive , and do not feed , nurture , and support growth and thriving . that is the difference to survive or to thrive . this challenge of depression is something that i continue to have to work with all these years later , and has improved so much with my learning studying getting help and support sharing with very close and trusted friends family , and practicing the best , most important decisions i have ever made are to say no to my ego and become humble and look for , study , and ask for help and accept support and the discomfort of growing . it has made all the difference , and is the only way to free ourselves from the ego control fear anger trap and live freely as love giving and receiving , joyful , real people . just like when we were smaller kids an additional note you did not come out and say it directly , but from your description of therapy and your comment about low quality in the you . s . , it seems like your experience opening up and trusting someone with that therapist ended up not working to give you concrete tools , real empathy , and some practical support when in fact you needed it . you are right that not all therapists are equal , just like doctors are not i have found that in both cases , when you have a clear need not just a simple annual checkup , for example , it is best to shop around that does not mean dropping one when you get frustrated that is part of learning to work through relationships and we practice in therapy what it does mean is that doing a first session with a couple of different therapists from different styles or training can really help if at first you do not click . and asking questions interviewing the therapist not the whole time , also trying out a mini session and seeing how it sits with you . <end>"

seems wrong with me . thinking back , i do not remember the last time i had genuinely laughed . the reason i stopped going for therapy sessions is that my mother could not afford it . she could have

weekly routine . i understand that moving is hard for you , and from what i have read , this took place maybe years ago . i hear that psychology takes a hefty amount of time to study and you said you were a counselor but not yet practicing so i can safely assume you are maybe about ish years old . i understand that leaving your best friend was hard as i had left several good friends of mine . but

straight . i will get to answering anything you have mentioned in your comment . <end>","<start> hi again , thanks for taking the time to share your thoughts . here s the problem thoughts are not everything . they do not make us either fully intelligent , nor fully human . humans , and other animals , are by nature both reason feeling beings , plus will choice decision commitment to values . you must decide to be humble you have already expressed great capacity to do this and to overcome your ego in the past an avoid puffing yourself up and in doing this , you will become a student of life , and of emotions . deciding to become falsely unemotional is not a solution , just like deciding not to eat would be unhealthy . you must choose to learn , study not as a therapist , as a human being committed to growth and health , and seek support and help in doing so . that way , you will not allow yourself will certain behaviors based on emotion , including your fear of emotion which has led you to try to cut it off completely . it is okay at the time , you did not realize , and your mother and therapist did not either . you were probably good at convincing her and yourself , but it was not an honest choice , since you clearly needed to grow and be supported , like we all do . it is okay and normal to be overwhelmed and scared when we are learning something it is natural . strong people embrace that fear and feel it , and do the right thing and the courageous thing , which is to ignore the ego and choose to love and grow . to do that , like when you learn a new sport or a new subject at school , you get good books , you study , you practice , and you get good teachers . and you accept the discomfort and the struggle , right it does not stop you from wanting to get good at it . emotions are no different , and even more important you will become a martial artist of happiness and connection and joy . of satisfaction , pride in who you are as a character , and peace . instead , by blocking emotions and stopping support , you actually accidentally stunted your growth , like stopping taking vitamins . reading more about your experience with your therapist , it sounds like the writing down of all the emotions , and then abruptly stopping therapy , was overwhelming . you chose to intellectualize and decide to block them . that is not a healthy or sustainable choice . finances would have been better spent on your future through therapy . your future is not financial academic , but the whole reality of your mental emotional physical health , which are all related . intellectualization and denial are defenses which do not serve us long term . therapy and working on ourselves helps us develop real coping skills which allow us to thrive , not just get by . right now , that is what you get to choose to do thrive , and stop just surviving , because you woke up to the truth that something is not right in your choice , years ago , to defend against your emotions by trying to shut them down . clarification going to therapy does not mean one has mental illness . it means one is smart , recognizes areas that need to grow , and finds a way to heal and grow them faster and better through support . it is a sign of strength and intelligence to know our limitations and seek to grow . period . trauma is difficult , taxing experience . and it does not always have immediate noticeable effects . it also accumulates over time . and can be suddenly coming to a crisis like the one you had when you decided to shut down and stop therapy . that choice was also a defense you intellectualized it was financial , but it was fear of doing the work and being uncomfortable , too . and both of those feelings are okay and normal , but we have to choose to grow , and that requires us choosing to be humble and be students of life to learn how to handle our emotions healthily . in fact , your mentioning if you were to take a life is an indication of what happens when we make unhealthy , defensive choices in dealing with our emotions we stop functioning intelligently and well . you must decide that will never be an option , no matter how you feel or do not feel . that is will . and then , you work to awaken your natural , inborn emotional intelligence by learning , getting support , and practicing , one day at a time . that is how to avoid mental illness , suffering , and poor life choices . you cannot talk about a future without talking about yourself as a whole , emotional mental physical spiritual person . that is true for all of us . you have got a great heart , now grow it , and grow it up into the love you are and were born to feel . <end>"

2142,<start> attracted to my therapist <end>,"<start> this is not uncommon at all . it is really up to you to decide if it is going to get in the way of doing the work but the best thing to do once you have mustered the courage is to talk about it with your therapist . it is not uncommon because more often than not , a good therapist is helping to meet some of the needs you have in your life that have gone unmet , possibly for a long time . they can represent an ideal parental figure , friend , or partner if you are attracted to them . the problem with this is that it is built on an ideal and not a reality . even if your therapist self discloses a lot , at the end of the day , you do not really know them , who they are , and what they are like outside of the professional setting . if they are a good therapist , you will never know . you are more likely in love with the idealistic image of them you have created than the person themselves . this can actually be really useful stuff to process and work through in therapy . in my experience both professional and person , it rarely does any good to keep things like this secret and bottled up . <end>"

2167,<start> i am scared of what happens after death . <end>,"<start> am not a therapist but maybe this could help you . all life is a reflection of existence and the universe . we as human beings in a collective sense are personifications of the universe . all our good , all our bad , our thoughts , fears , actions . are simply a reflection of the chaotic insane beautiful impossible to comprehend reality of this remention of existence . now the most essential base rule of life is the first law of thermodynamics . nothing can be destroyed only changed . things fall apart and then they come together again . this is the endless beautiful cycle of the universe that we get to be apart of . it is literally impossible for your life to be extinguished . you will not end you will be transformed . you have been so many other things before you were you and you have faced death an endless amount of times and you will continue to endlessly until the universe itself collapses and is destroyed and eventually transformed anew . repeating the cycle again . i understand how scary it can be . we have all felt that unimaginable feeling of horror at some point in our lives . that deep indescribable fear that pierces your soul . the idea that that feeling could be waiting for us after death is horrifying but that just would not make any sense at all . existence is not vindictive or cruel . if it was life itself would not function . no matter what your state of existence there will be good and bad . same as your life now . one day you will be something or someone or just part of the very essence of the universe and you will not remember this life and that you were afraid . you will just exist . <end>"

2228,<start> i need some advice on what kind of therapist to see . <end>,"<start> the most important thing you need in a therapist is someone you feel comfortable with . with that being said , faith based does not necessarily mean that they will use spirituality with you if you are not religious so they should not be pushing their views on you . if your mom is willing to do therapy with you then family therapy would be great , but if you are planning on going yourself you do not need a family therapist . as far as the bds , as long as it is not interfering with your functioning and it is consensual , there is really no reason a therapist would be bothered by it . if you are interested it music and think music therapy would be helpful go for it . if that is not your thing and you just want traditional talk therapy you should not have any trouble finding a therapist . cognitive behavioral therapy is probably the most commonly used and that would probably be a great start . if you do not think it is working out , you can always switch therapists or ask about different approaches . i hope this helps and i wish you the best of luck on your therapeutic journey . <end>"

2237,<start> how to talk to my parents about my mental health <end>,"<start> mmmm . i do not really know your age , but in my experience , discussing my own mental health with my parents is a very bad idea because they are judgmental and unsupportive and they think they have all the answers they certainly are not professionals , nor are they anything close to having professional knowledge . your parents probably will not be any different from mine . so with that in mind , i might just say something along the lines of , does our health insurance cover counselors i think i would like to start going to one . if your parents are anything like mine , then that is literally all the information you should give them the specifics are not any of their business . and if you give them specifics , they might ask you about your mental health for the next five years , and i highly doubt you want that . <end>"
2238,<start> what is the best path for me to become a therapist <end>,"<start> i do not know how selective every grad school is , but i was able to get in with my film degree and a long career in customer service . i did not understand it at the time , but when i interviewed for my graduate program they were scanning for things like self awareness , and an ability to conceptualize things like conflict in a systemic manner the systemic thinking is specific my training as a marriage and family therapist . anyway , i pretty much just strove to be as honest and transparent as i could , and i got in . since you seem to only be interested in being a master s level clinician , you have options in the us lock , lips , and left . i have zero clue what it takes to be an lips , but many , many lifts and locks that i know come from non psychology backgrounds and were able to get into grad programs for these license tracks . if you are in the united states you might want to look into providing services to under served rural communities when you graduate . there are still loan forgiveness programs for doing this , although not as robust as they once were . <end>"
2239,<start> how to help my of with self image issues <end>,"<start> sorry that the doctor said that it sounds like it is been really difficult . can i ask , what is it that your of needs from you right now it is okay if you do not know but this might be a helpful question to ask . battling body image and weight issues can be hard , and i would really recommend to focus on being her boyfriend rather than anything else . it is easy to want to fill the role of eating coach , gym buddy etc but the role you have is important enough . <end>"
2240,<start> what was wrong with me my brain started playing tricks on me a couple of years ago . <end>,<start> i am no therapist but it sounds like schizophrenia . i would go talk to a medical professional and get on the right meds as soon as possible . <end>
2241,<start> i am no therapist but it sounds like schizophrenia . i would go talk to a medical professional and get on the right meds as soon as possible . <end>,<start> i do not think it was schizophrenia because i did not really hear the voices . from what i understand when schizophrenics hear and see things their brain actually sees and hears them . i just kind of convinced myself of these things . also i am much much better now . i have not thought of these stories in years . <end>
2242,"<start> f , seriously derailing my weight loss and feeling depressed <end>","<start> i hope this does not come across as judgmental , because i mean this from a place of love and care and empathy . i am not a therapist . i am a woman who recovered from an eating disorder , but still struggles with bingeing and restricting behaviours sometimes . to me , it seems like you posted this in askatherapist because you are aware that this is not a healthy mindset to have , and maybe you are hoping someone will tell you that , and that you do not need to lose weight . a therapist can not tell you how to lose pounds . you are already quite slim , and your issue here it seems is your restricting and bingeing and body dystrophia , not a need to lose weight . losing pounds will not make you body positive . university is extremely stressful , and it is difficult to eat well and take care of yourself . i advise that you look into getting a therapist who specializes in eating disorders to help you through this . recovery is a lifelong journey , and i wish you all the best <end>"
2243,<start> what type of therapy would be most beneficial <end>,"<start> the most important thing is finding a therapist you are comfortable with . as the previous commenter states , most therapists are eclectic and will use different approaches for different clients . at least i think that is what they were getting at , which is a good suggestion because if you see someone who solely does cut and you do not like it then you would have to start over with someone else . based on what you stated i think there is a lot of approaches that could help . mindfulness and grounding techniques could help with emotional regulation so cut or debt would be a great start . you might also want to look into emir eye movement desensitization and reprocessing which sounds nuts at first but it is evidence based and essentially allows your brain to heal itself with a therapist as a guide . i hope this helps and i wish you the best of luck on your therapeutic journey . <end>"

2253,"<start> is psychosis frequent with patients with bed if so , how and how does it differ from regular schizophrenia <end>","<start> what you are describing sounds more like paranoid ideation rather than the delusional paranoia that is typically experienced during psychosis . paranoid ideation is in fact a symptom of bed and is even amongst the diagnostic criteria in the dam . as for the hallucinations , this is not unheard of with bed . you could also potentially be looking at a case of co morbidity with an additional disorder or mental health issue . i would do some reading not too much online just google bed any symptom and wait until you are next therapy session . i wish you the best <end>"

2272,<start> thank you so much this was really good . is it normal for a therapist to spend . yrs stabilizing a client before addressing the deeper stuff <end>,"<start> all depends on what kind of therapist they are . for most therapists , no , this is not usual . in my work with clients , their treatment goals are usually met or at least they have made enough progress to no longer need therapy by the . year mark . they may return to therapy for refreshers or later on to work on a separate issue , but the issue they came in with is generally resolved within that time period . . . . or . . . i refer them to someone else who i think may be able to help them in a different way than i can that may be a better fit . for therapists that are more psychodynamic relational , they tend to be focused on more long term therapy . it can be extremely helpful for some folks and not work for others . all in all , while a lot of therapists either forget to do this or do not make it part of their practice , we are ethically obligated to explain to clients how we practice , discuss what treatment looks like both explaining the frequency of visits , how long the sessions are , and an estimated time frame of how long therapy should take to resolve the presenting issue . this is all part of getting a client s consent to treatment . if you do not have this information , you do not really know what you are consenting to when you enter into therapy with any particular practitioner . <end>"
2273,<start> i have no idea if there is something wrong with me or not . <end>,"<start> so , first , there is nothing wrong with you . i think too often we are told we are weird or wrong , but that just leads to feelings of shame . it sounds like you likely had some childhood trauma , alcoholics tend to do that to their family . avoidance is an indicator of trauma , as the feelings are so overwhelming . however , avoidance does not work long term , and the feelings always catch up to us eventually . know that when you are feeling sad , it is ok to feel sad . and when you feel happy , that is ok too . all of your feelings are normal , and this experience is not unusual . i would suggest talking to someone would be helpful , but understand that would be hard . it is the only real way to process what you have been through . some things you can do on your own is practice mindfulness be aware of your thoughts and feelings without judging them i am sure you could google all kinds of activities . practice relaxation skills , and consider yoga . yoga is being shown to be great for mental health . you can consider reading books or workbooks , and maybe start with something that is uplifting like a irene brown ted talk . she is amazing and has a bunch of books . i am not sure exactly what direction to send you in , but i think it is important to start increasing awareness of your feelings and just acknowledge them . they are not weird or wrong , they are just trying to tell you something . think of them like extra senses . your nose helps you smell , your eyes help you see , and your anger tells you something is bothering you . your joy tells you that something should continue and sadness is related to feelings of loss . they are just telling you something that you need to know . hope this helps <end>"

2289,<start> can a therapist prescribe traveling or going out for the people who suffer from depression <end>,"<start> there is no cure for depression . depression is a lifelong battle for many . there are some who only struggle with it situationally or exhibit symptoms of it during an adjustment disorder but many will tell you its lifelong for them . of course it can and will get better and treatment will depend on the therapist and the client . in my opinion i would work to build teach coping mechanisms for my clients that they will be able to use consistently and regularly . i am not sure that traveling is something that can be done regularly enough to help . this can vary on the client . if my client has a passion for traveling it may be time to explore a career change or hobby or something like that , but i am not there to advice them to go traveling . i am not there to give any advice , really . i am there to help them explore what about traveling is so good for them and how to find that in other aspects of life . is my client practicing enough self care how do they cope with stress others may disagree with me , but that is how i would approach your question . counseling is based on the wellness model , where psychiatry is more on the medical based model so i would personally refrain from saying i prescribed anything . again , this is just my perspective based on my guiding theory , schooling , and training . <end>"
2290,<start> honest question life as a young man <end>,"<start> historical social norms you are right , relationships are heavily conjured up and empathised massively by society . i have always wondered apart from pro creation what is the obsession with having to be in a relationship it a considered the norm so much so that although i think it is got much better some people consider you weird if you are not in one . you do not need other people to be happy . you sound like you are lonely and think a of will fill this void . loneliness is just boredom . that is not a healthy reason to get into a relationship . a lot of people never stop and question what the reasons are for why they got into a relationship . most of the time it is just to fulfil a need so it is conditional . and it is very much like a trade , except we say i love you instead of i trade you . . . and when said person stops fulfilling that need the other person gets bored , seeks the need fulfilment elsewhere or leaves . you need to learn to be ok by yourself . enjoy doing things by yourself and if you are not willing to do all the said adult things you mentioned then you need to focus on that too . you need to be your best possible version to meet someone who can match that for you so that you can have a great relationship . <end>"

2296,<start> i do not know how to open up <end>,"<start> wait a minute now . this is not r alanin . my first thought reading through this was pufftn . he is got a month old and he is tired and wants alone time . you have not met clingy yet , my friend . wait ll you have a whiny two year old . i totally get what you are saying , and i have been married for years and raised kids , so i have some experience here . i am not putting the blame on you . absolutely , it is on your wife to make friends and develop interests , but hear me when i say , your wife just spent months pregnant , giving birth is pretty traumatic , and you have got the hormone cocktail going on . she is likely sleep deprived , her body has probably changed , she is probably unsure of herself , and second guessing everything she is doing for that baby , on top of trying to care for her own body that is healing . put all that on top of being lonely and whatever issues there actually were to start with . if this is her first baby , she probably will not be able to see her own behavior attitude until she is passed this and can look back on it . of course , i am just speaking generally here . she could have all of this , none of this or any combo in between . now explain to me why we are encouraging the man that works outside of the house all day away from his wife and newborn to advocate for time alone . why are not we encouraging him to send his wife out for literally anything . . . exercise , shopping , manicure , just out into the sunlight with a clean shirt and no diaper bag . i like my alone time , too i feel you , but suck it up . this is adusting and you signed up for it . too late to change your mind , just because it is hard . what she is doing is hard , too , and she probably can not wait for you to get home . pushing her away right now is going to make her feel unattractive . you know how you always hear people say marriage is hard this is the hard part . it will get better , but if the plan is for her to be a sham , your job right now , is to support your family and support your wife by making sure she is taking care of herself , and mentally and physically in a good place so she does a good job taking care of the baby . otherwise , you are going to have a whole new set of problems . what you want does not matter anymore , it is whatever has to be done to take care of that baby . besides , you will be home alone with the baby while the wife is out , right <end>"
2297,<start> why do i no longer feel emotion <end>,"<start> i am not a therapist but no one has said anything yet so here i am . please seek professional help that is not reedit . if you are still in college there are definitely resources available to you , some kind of student counselor or even a professor you trust . i have been in a similar boat , it sounds like you might be depressed but obviously i am not qualified to diagnose anyone . it is really lucky , to say the least , but it is something that can be treated and managed do not give up i am sorry i can not do more for you <end>"
2298,<start> how to help a depressed person to make therapy appointments <end>,"<start> you can not force anyone to go to therapy . even if you would think it would help , therapy is not some panacea but a team effort between client and therapist . now the one exception is if they were to try to harm themselves via suicide . than you could ensure they are put in an inpatient center . however other than that , you need to accept that these people are not going . all you can do is watch unfortunately . at least your bf is on his meds . <end>"
2299,<start> remembering things post session <end>,"<start> it sounds like you have a pretty good idea of what might be helpful writing more and it could be good to brainstorm with your therapist on why it is hard and what might help . one thing that i think is super helpful for a lot of people including myself , is writing out a story about the relationship and the breakup . you just word vomit and write everything out as if you were explaining it to someone you trusted totally , but who did not know you or your partner . a lot of times this alone is enough to have an impact on making our feelings and abstract thoughts more concrete however it can also be helpful to edit it . some might find it helpful to edit it down to a one page summary they keep on their phone , so in times of confusion they can reread their own truth . sometimes , it can be helpful to take the story to therapy , and talk about what points feels foggy or have a particular negative feelings attached . <end>"

2302,<start> is it rude to ask a therapist about their personal experiences <end>,"<start> you can ask , but they will not disclose that information . it does not sound necessary that you know that . <end>"
2303,<start> why am i overstaring <end>,"<start> talking about things is helpful . that is one of the reasons people go to therapy . boundaries are important in friendships though . if you are not very close to someone , telling about your mental health issues or your struggles is going to be off putting . it is not so different than if you were to start talking about your sex life with someone you just met . with people you are close to , it should be okay , but even with these folks , if the majority of your conversations with them center around your mental health issues , especially if you are frequently always seeking support from the same folks , it could wear them out and they may not stick around very long . once again , a good reason why many folks go to see a therapist . it is our job to listen , help you process , and figure out ways to overcome these difficulties . we may care about you , but we are not your friends . for some folks , therapy can be a dumping ground so that they can fulfill their need to talk about it without sacrificing their friendships , at least early on until they have gotten a better handle on things . <end>"
2304,<start> how to effectively take a mental health day <end>,"<start> i would taking the day to relax and set things up for your future self . like make appointments with therapist and or psychiatrists , clean the house or just your room , do laundry , find and try some new coping skills , and just relax . play some video games , watch tv , whatever you enjoy . i personally do not think spending the entire day playing games is the best use of a mental health day , like you should get a couple things done , but games are a big part of it <end>"

2327,<start> therapists is there a diagnosis for well meaning sycophants <end>,"<start> i have a friend like this . at the very least she has anxious preoccupied attachment issues and is probably somewhere on the bed spectrum . some argue it is not a spectrum , but i disagree . i have been telling her time and time and time again to stop buying things for me , but i gather gifts are her love language , and she believes ingratiating herself will prevent me from leaving . but i am not an expert , just my half crocked theory . . . <end>"
2328,<start> what to do if someone will not see a therapist <end>,"<start> just from what i am interpreting from your text she kind of reminds me of my self when it comes to opening up . i also find it that when girls want to discuss their feelings on certain issues not all of course every human is different they want to be heard more than want someone to offer solutions . when it is me and my male amigos were offering solutions and of course sometimes we just listen but i think it is a guy thing to want to fix things right away . just be there for . kind of got off my point but yeah reminds me of myself in this sense . if someone knows i am going thru things and they bring it up or say want to talk about it . my response instantly is omao fuuuucccckkkkk no son but it will naturally come out when i am feeling it like me and my dude just spent the whole day kicking it now we laying back or some shit tired and it is night time and also if the subject of the convo naturally has this undertone of i can relate to this i will let my walls crumble a bit and open up . i say try to tire her out by taking her to the gym be goofy as hell if she is shy at the gym too . if your more embarrassing than her she is going to feel so confident . i did this with my kind of over weight friend and it did wonders to his confidence . constantly showered him in compliments when he did things great but still was telling him when things were wrong . get out more , sunshine is fucking great , obviously not going to change her from but just going out , working out will do wonders . go for walks find a nice bench with a view or something does not have to be the grand canyon type of view even a hill in a soccer field just sit and let the convo naturally come out . do not force the therapy for sure . if she is a drinker stop the booze . that means for yourself too especially if you are living together . do not smoke weed either fucks with a persons mind to much if they have troubles in the mental . good luck my friend <end>"

2331,<start> what kind of therapist should i look for <end>,<start> i am inclined to say start with an autism therapist because regardless of what the other therapists specialize in it will not be helpful if they can not explain it in a way that makes sense for you . and with autism work there are skills you can build that will make you feel more comfortable and that can reduce your anxiety . but the most important thing with choosing a therapist is that you feel heard and that you feel respected . the rest is just gravy . <end>

2344,<start> is it add or trauma <end>,"<start> it can be difficult for clinicians to rule out trauma . the absence of his father could certainly have been processed as trauma trauma is relative , and children with trauma backgrounds tend to fit the add checklists and can be diagnosed with add . both can impact executive functioning which is the part of the brain that affects impulses , mood and behavioral regulation , and organization planning . a neuropsychologist evaluation could be helpful in deciphering this . those evaluations can be expensive , so if your insurance will not cover it , a good place to start could be requesting an evaluation by the school psychologist . i think you also could consider what differences there would be in support if it were diagnosis over the other definitely necessary if you are ever considering the medication route add meds are really over prescribed , although they do not usually medicate children that young . i would also advocate for social emotional support at school either way , and possibly interventions and supports to focus on supporting the organizational piece in the classroom . outside therapy can also be a helpful outlet either way , especially if there is a history he may benefit from processing through . <end>"

2347,<start> why do i feel like someone is controlling me <end>,"<start> it sounds like you are in crisis and you should seek out mental health help as soon as possible . reach out to an adult you trust a teacher , a school counselor , a coach and tell them that you have tried to harm yourself and are still trying to harm yourself and that you need help to ensure your safety . your symptoms sound like some type of psychosis . it is not uncommon for people to feel like they are being controlled or being forced to do bad things . feeling like that must be really scary and i am so proud of you for reaching out and asking for help . medication and therapy can help what you are experiencing . there are good adults who will help you . please tell someone in your life what is going on so they can get you the services you need . <end>"
2348,<start> can i tell a therapist this asking for a friend <end>,"<start> therapists are generally mandated reporters , so if someone disclosed abuse to us , we are required to report it . that was likely in your intake paperwork or she mentioned it in your first session . therapists take confidentiality very seriously except when it comes to abuse disclosures or if you are a risk of harm to yourself or others , like if you told your therapist you were going to go home and kill yourself . personally , if a client told me they were purposely starving themselves with the intention to die of starvation , that would be different than the intention of losing weight . i would encourage you to tell your mom and offer support or offer for you to tell her about it in session , but i do not think i would just outright report it unless you were at immediate risk of harm to yourself . however , i work in foster care , so our rules about disclosing are a little different than a therapist in private practice , so you may have to take my words with a grain of salt . edit this is coming as a human being and not as a therapist . your mom quilting you for talking to your therapist instead of her is not cool . i do not know your situation , but it is common for abusive parents to say things like how could you talk to someone else about our family matters with an emphasis on keeping all your shit within the family . if you do not let anyone in , no one can see how bad things are . i am not suggesting that is what your mom is doing , but it is a good thing to keep in mind for the future . <end>"

2366,<start> how do you know when you are ready to stop seeing your therapist <end>,"<start> obligatory not a therapist or health professional , but i was depressed and had anxiety panic attacks relatively frequently for a good majority of last year , and my bi weekly therapy sessions were lifesaving . i knew that i was ready when i found that my therapist had helped me to the point where my daily journal she recommended i restarted writing became sufficient for getting everything out . i became self sustaining and no longer felt like my therapist was the only thing getting me through my weeks . she recommended daily journaling and also mentioned that i should take action against my depression and try a little more every day to get out of bed and do the things i love , as those were things i had found extremely difficult to do the past couple months . <end>"
2367,<start> kinks <end>,<start> i mean you can stop acting on them but as far as losing interest in your fetishes its generally not achievable but as long as you are not hurting other people without consent and its not illegal you should know that it is perfectly fine to be attracted to weird things the human spectrum of sexuality is extremely complicated and diverse and almost always out of the control of the individual . most of those attractions are set in childhood and it does not make you any less normal then the next person with a secret fetish . more people have kinks then you would think . be proud of it . <end>
2368,<start> weird story therapist and conflicted <end>,"<start> one thing to be certain is that you should never really expect to get a whole lot or feel fixed after one therapy session . therapist is process that can take time . first sessions are generally focused on allowing the clinician to get to know you a little bit and allowing you to get to know them . every therapist works differently , some share anecdotes and personal experiences in order to help teach something or let you get to know them and others will not talk about themselves at all . i generally tell folks to give it three sessions working with a therapist . if you feel like there is a connection and they may be able to help you , great , if not , move on and immediately look for a new therapist . if cost a big concern , you may want to just move on now , but also make sure that you realize for even the briefest of therapies to be effective , it is likely you are going to need to go to weekly sessions for a good while for it to be effective . make sure you are able to budget for this as you do not want to blow a bunch of money on or sessions and have to drop out due to finances . then you will be out that money and likely will not see any substantial results . being in the you . s . i do not know much about this human givens approach as it seems pretty uk centric , new , and not very well established . the little bit of internet diving i did , it does not seem like it is an evidenced based practice or that there is much research on it . i would be somewhat wary of practitioners pushing something like this . here s the thing . every therapist has a framework that they prefer to work from , but many therapists are eclectic and can use various different modalities in their treatment . if what your therapist is doing is not working for you , tell them . let them know what aspects of their working with you helps you and which does not . many will be able and willing to adjust . for those that can not or will not , then it is time to seek a different therapist . <end>"

2388,<start> am i wrong <end>,"<start> i believe that what you are asking would be very difficult to determine over a reedit post . . . but i will try anyways . a persons personal experiences and belief systems are a complicated and nuanced jumble that helps make someone who they are . i know that may not be especially helpful in this moment , but it could be helpful moving forward . my favorite say to the kids i work with is how you feel is real , but it may not be true . now , that is not to say you are somehow dishonest . all that statement is meant to do is to be a way to check things in with yourself by slowing down your thoughts and feelings . from the little you have said , how you feel is real , and right now , maybe the battle you are fighting is trying to understand if it is true or not and then trying to convince your therapist the same . you are the expert on you . if you say you are out of sorts and something is wrong , then it is likely true . the struggle then becomes agreeing on a name . instead , maybe it would be more beneficial in the short term to collectively focus on interventions that can improve your general mood or feeling , and more importantly , assure your safety . <end>"

2405,<start> a question concerning sexual kink in a relationship . <end>,"<start> this is a pretty common sexual fantasy . quite a bit less common for the fantasy to be enacted , but still not terribly uncommon . talking about it with the two of you is a great start . what sexual fantasies does she have there are a great deal of ways to tap into part of that sexual fantasy you have without involving another person . using a vibrator or dildo or digital stimulation to simulate the experience is one of the things that is just off the top of my head . a sex therapist and any good couples therapist can really help you explore this together pretty well . also there is a lot you can do just together from talking about each of you all s fantasies and finding ways to enact the parts you are comfortable with . <end>"
2406,<start> what are some techniques to get over social anxiety . <end>,"<start> i know it sounds counterintuitive but for me , being out in the world helped with my social anxiety . do not get me wrong , i still have a lot of anxiety in certain situations but putting myself into social interactions has helped me to get used to the idea of being around people . there is no wrong way to do it . you can be quiet until you feel comfortable enough to speak to people . it is not going to happen over night and there are going to be bad days but you will probably get more comfortable over time . <end>"

2434,<start> can a person self diagnose themself by searching the dam <end>,"<start> not a therapist self diagnoses are extremely risky and dangerous . we are often very biased to the stories of our own lives . and in most cases , we are the worst critics of our own stories because of these biases . we can easily be convinced that we know everything there is to know about ourselves . we see ourselves act in the real world , who could know me better than myself but sometimes , we need a mirror to reflect on events that happen , in a clear manner . clinicians are those mirrors , and in most cases pretty pristine ones at that . there is no real way of diagnosing yourself of anything other than seeing a professional that deals with suspected diagnoses . if you do feel like there is something big in your life you feel you would like to understand more , but may not be able to on your own , reach out to a therapist . it is totally worth having a neutral party to help talk through it with . one thing i will suggest however that you can implement on your own , to bring clarity , and an introspective view on your life , is having a journal . taking minutes a day to just be completely honest with yourself about what you feel , what is on your mind , why you think you feel like this , and why this is on your mind . all of this will definitely bring more insight into your life , and what you go through everyday . self honesty is a vastly underrated form of taking steps toward understanding yourself and others more clearly . i hope this helps <end>"

2442,<start> question about ethics <end>,"<start> i kind of have two minds about your question , so i am going to try to explain my thought process a little bit . first of all , i would say it would unethical for a therapist you have not seen in the past two years to share a diagnosis , or anything really with your wife after the fact like that . the waters are a little more muddy when it comes to couples therapy , but even then , she was your therapist as well as your wife s , and discussing something about you like that could likely be seen as a breach of your confidentiality . that being said , i wonder how that conversation between the wife and therapist actually went . odds are , she was sharing quite a few negative situations and complaints about you , that may have met the criteria for narcissistic tendencies , and who knows what the therapist said in response to that . of course that is not a real diagnosis , and i am pretty sure everybody has narcissistic tendencies at some point . have you ever lacked empathy been arrogant haughty maybe somebody perceives you as entitled . maybe they believe that you are exploitive . these are all characteristics of a narcissistic person , but an actual diagnosis requires it to be a pervasive pattern . you are not wrong for denying that you are a narcissist . you are right , anybody who is not a narcissist who was accused of being a narcissist would also deny that . just because an actual narcissist would also deny being a narcissist does not prove anything . as to what you should do , personally , i probably would not do anything but continue to have discussions with my wife about what it means to her that she thought i was narcissist . or what it say about her . if she truly thinks you are a narcissistic person who has no empathy for anybody , why would she want to be in a relationship with that person . it might be helpful to have more marriage counseling to help resolve those issues . if you really wanted to , i am sure you could find a psychologist who would also be able to put you through some amount of questioning and testing and come up with an official diagnosis . although i probably would not go that far . as for the therapist , there really are three options . one , do nothing . two , contact the therapist and ask her about what she told your wife . three , if you really think it is an issue , you could contact her professional licensing or ethics board , and make a complaint . but , without knowing what therapist actually said , versus what your wife has incorrectly interpreted or told you about that conversation , that might not go very far . <end>"

2454,<start> how much to tell a therapist <end>,"<start> in my practice , i usually safety plan for passive suicidal ideation and only resort to crisis unit hospitalization if the ideation is active . telling me you want to go to sleep and not wake up is a lot different than telling me you are going to go home and overdose . there are exceptions to the rules and it really depends on the session context and so many other factors i would encourage you to be open and honest with your therapist , so i would just ask her what she would do if you expressed suicidal ideation . it is a fairly obvious question but it can come up naturally in your first session when she reviews confidentiality practices with you . <end>"

2465,"<start> whoa cool question i think society does play an important role in how people handle traumatic events , so i wonder what a beating meant in ancient greece versus now . if beatings from parents were more common at that time , perhaps that would make the incident less likely to be outright traumatic in the sense of causing flashbacks and apprehension , but perhaps more subtly showing up as a great deal of shame note that this is all highly speculative . i have never lived in a society where beatings were normalized . but let us say for the sake of your story that my speculation is accurate . he would be carrying around all this shame , and his perception of his female partners already shaded by ancient greek attitudes towards women would be to consider their role in sex shameful so far that is in line with your madonna whore theory . so he might be irritated in general by his partner because she literally embodies the shameful part of sex . but , people who have a deep seated shame surrounding sex often process that into a kink . it is possible that your main character could develop a fetish for oral sex . perhaps his way of processing his initial shame and other cultural baggage around it is to feel ridiculously turned on by it and possibly to ask for additional pleasure and pain dynamics to be introduced , such as having his partner restrain him so that he can not resist this shameful act , spankings and other s m type punishment . he may also develop a fetish for being the shameful one performing oral sex on his female partner . . . . suffice it to say your scenario brings up lots of creative possibilities where your character might be conflicted and unsure if he can love his partner for being so shameful , or if he might find a deep and abiding love for her for being so kind and understanding , and for allowing him to do these shameful acts . he might truly appreciate his partner because he is able to be his true self and drop his masculine persona . as for his other relationships . . . it sounds like he would have to hide his past and if you choose to go in the direction of kinks as i have suggested , then he would have to hide his kinks from them too . his friendships would be good , but there would always be an element of holding certain things back . think of it sort of like being in the closet . i had friends who were in a poly relationship , and before they disclosed the true nature of their relationship to us we were definitely close . however , our relationship bonded and became so much closer not to mention more complicated when they told us their secret . please know that his male friendships would be fulfilling , but incomplete . and for those he let us in behind the mask , perhaps he might have a friend who let us it slip that he enjoys something shameful too , and he can share his secret with this friend , those friendships are likely to become very emotionally intimate . relationships with children it depends on the child s personality to be sure . boys i anticipate he would be trying to get them to be faultlessly male , while having the inner conflict of not living that standard himself . perhaps there is emotional intimacy possible there if his child thinks dad is faultlessly male , but dad reveals he is not faultlessly male to his son . that would probably bond them together in a way that is difficult to describe . even today men struggle to be vulnerable . but when one of us manages to let some cracks in the wall show , it is sort of like handing someone a knife with the understanding that they can stab you in the back at any time , but also knowing they will not . girls i imagine he would be transmitting a lot of negative attitudes about women to his daughters , perhaps by way of showing he cares by explaining to them how they are inherently flawed , and how they can avoid some of the worst parts of their nature . he would probably think he was coming from a place of love while doing some damage . since i am proposing a character arc for your character of learning to accept his own femininity more , then perhaps the relationship with his daughter would be to stop policing her so much and just love her for who she is <end>","<start> thank you so much for writing such a detailed , well thought out answer you have been tremendously helpful , i really can not thank you enough . i think in my character s case , the beating happens when the character is caught in the act , and is severe enough to require medical attention the fact that his mentor did not protect him and abandoned him after combined with the extreme boundary violation of his father interrupting such a sexually charged event with overkill brutality would , i think , create a profound break in his ability to love himself and trust others . your point about developing a kink to safely explore taboo desires makes so much sense but when one of us manages to let some cracks in the wall show , it is sort of like handing someone a knife with the understanding that they can stab you in the back at any time , but also knowing they will not . shew masculinity

2471,"<start> hey thanks for responding first of all . . also i might say that my empathy for other people is very picky if that makes sense i only feel for people i truly care about which only happens once in a full moon also something that has to do with me not trusting people and assuming people do not actually care for me but just think they do to not think of themselves as bad people if that makes sense i have been noticing that most of my lack of empathy is cognitive and just understanding people in general and my assumptions about people before i meet them because of pretty bad past experience . i have add and have taken tests on the internet for being a hip hyper sensitive person and am not really sure anymore wether i lack empathy because of my past abuse or wether i am just a hurt over sensitive individual that is scared to care about other people . i also have been reading fiction books with the idea to learn from it which i feel like has somewhat increased my cognitive empathy by putting myself in other people s shoes and reflecting back on what i have just read and try my hardest to understand the person more instead of viewing them as evil stupid for their decisions . also there have been instances in my life where i can remember crying for people i have never met when i was about years old and going through a rough time in my life myself i would google images videos articles about syrian children and cry in front on my computer because i wanted to help them and felt for them and wanted to take action to change their lives or save them . it probably sounds weird but i did it and there have been more times in my life where i would do that things that like that make me think that i do not lack empathy , or that it is more something i choose to have . when my grandma went to the hospital and me and her had lighted a lot before that i did not seem to care that much and was kind of happy that she was gone and more interested in what i would gain from it financially if she died but after maybe a few hours after dancing and not caring i kind of started caring . same happened with my grandpa , even though he actually died x b p . s sorry if this was too long , i just want to know what you think <end>","<start> i really admire the work you are doing here to grow and be better , it takes a lot of strength and it sounds like you are really searching for ways to change your attitudes and learn how to empathise . no one is perfect and we all should look at ourselves and see where we need to improve every so often . it sounds like you maybe numb your feelings as a defence mechanism you assume people do not care and will hurt you let you down so you block of your feelings so you do not get hurt . the brain thinks it is helping you here but as we can see it is actually detrimental to your relationships and ability to have positive interactions with others . when you say you lack cognitive empathy because you struggle to understand people is this due to your trauma you feel people are like those who hurt you this could be projection if the trauma is not addressed we can project our feelings towards those that hurt us onto others . projection can also be when we unconsciously protect ourselves by denying the existence of something within ourselves and attribute it to others . how does your add effect you you did say you have empathy occasionally with people you truly care for , what does that feel like i am not really sure anymore whether i lack empathy because of my past abuse or whether i am just a hurt over sensitive individual that is scared to care about other people . i felt this was quite powerful , and it could be a bit of both to care about others and let yourself have feelings for them is to allow yourself to be vulnerable it is through vulnerability that we form true connections but vulnerability can feel really scary after a bad experience . what you said about reading is a great step towards improving your cognitive empathy it sounds like you are studying them like a text so you can learn and understand , that is great you could continue this with different characters and personalities , such as those you might encounter girl . in your last paragraph you explain moments of genuine emotional empathy as if you caught feelings , and that a part of you was devested by the unnecessary pain these individuals went through , perhaps you could relate to them in some way . the syrian children were safer for you than your grandparents because you did not have a personal relationship with them . it could have been a defence to not care or think of what you would gain a positive even but your suppressed feelings began to push through . remember just because you are not

2480,<start> is there a name for when a person bottles up their emotions usually does not feel emotions and then suddenly gets an overload emotional breakdown <end>,"<start> its called repression . to repress emotions is to just hide them away , push them down until it leaks out later in outbursts , bad behavior or manifests as stomach cancer later in life . <end>"

2483,<start> i know this . it is so hard to do . <end>,<start> i fully agree that it is hard to do . there is no magic therapy bullet for this . you just have to have some resolve that it is time to worry more about yourself . <end>

2485,<start> how can i stop allowing rejection from lost jobs and workers make me miserable <end>,"<start> sounds like you are ready to change this is wonderful i would suggest a few things . figure out what you are actually good at . not necessarily what you like , or want to do , or what is lucrative , but what you have skills in . begin to investigate jobs that would play to those strengths instead of playing to your resume . you may have to take another shit job just to pay the bills , but it is easier to work a shit job if you are in school to change careers which is something i have personal experience doing . i used to think that my ability to deal with all sorts of people in all sorts of moods was a death sentence to spend the rest of my days in dead end customer service roles . i was wrong . . start communicating with local therapists email , phone , whatever , and see if someone in your area has some experience helping someone discern career choices , and general workplace difficulty . i think you would do well in therapy right now because you sound like you are tired of your old thinking patterns . you might also ask the therapists in your area if any of them have ever personally been fired or had to change careers before getting into their current line of work . someone like that could be a good role model of sorts and i know many therapists come to the field later in life like this one . . i dunno . a list just does not feel like a list with only two items , so here s rufus thomas singing my current theme song http youth . be b tp perdu which probably will not help you very much , but it sure is funky . <end>"
2486,<start> fear of being healthy . <end>,"<start> i could not tell you , specifically , what it is about being healthy that you are afraid of , but i did want to say that i do not find it so strange that it would be scary to consider making these changes . is it counter intuitive sure , but so is a lot of human behavior . you have presumably lived in your current state of health for a long time , and your life as you live it now is designed by accident or intention around this . you have habits and routines that accommodate your health needs . you have relationships with specialists . you have a relationship with your fiance that has evolved around the context of your current state of health . even if you assume that everything about becoming healthier will be better , it will still be different , and until you begin to experience you will be left with unanswerable questions . from where will i derive comfort how will the dynamics of my relationships change who am i without these health issues it is scary stuff , change , whether good , bad , or otherwise . but if you really want to be healthy , just take it day by day . nothing will change in an instant , and you will have time to figure out adapt to your new circumstances . good luck <end>"
2487,<start> how to cope with loneliness <end>,"<start> some of the issues described sound like they could be clinically significant symptoms of mental illness . different types of therapy offer different types of coping skills . i am thinking you may want to look into for how to heal attachment issues . there is self help books focusing on that approach and of course many other options , but that is where i would start if you do not want to do therapy but of course you are asking a therapist so of course i would recommend therapy . <end>"
2488,<start> new relationship with someone who has depression <end>,"<start> rule everyone is responsible for their own sexual satisfaction . if you follow this rule , and you are getting what you need i assume he participates through some combination of watching , using his hands , helping you with toys , etc , and he says he is getting satisfaction , then you have done your job as a solid sex partner i just made that name up . if he wants more , it is up to him to ask for it . edit you can make sure he knows that the lines of communication are open and you want to hear from him if he wants something from you . meanwhile , focus on making sure you are having a good time . setting aside my job as a therapist , and just speaking as a man who has sat around campfires trading sex stories , you might be surprised how much men care about making sure women have orgasms and enjoy having sex with them . despite the stereotype of men just wanting to get off , roll over , and fall asleep , many men care deeply about giving pleasure to their partner . <end>"

2492,<start> what ended up happening <end>,"<start> thanks for checking in we met the next time and i brought it up first thing . i explained pretty much what i wrote here , and she said she completely understood why i would have been confused . she told me that generally clients buzz in even if the door is unlocked to let her know they are here . so we talked about the miscommunication and general expectations around the space . i felt good about where we left it since then we have been doing some great work together , and honestly i feel like i am getting more out of therapy than i ever have before so far we are building a great relationship . i am pretty happy it was ultimately a great opportunity for me to practice communication <end>"
2493,<start> shyness and having no confidence in myself are destroying my life <end>,"<start> i have tried my best not be shy but i always becomes shy when i meet someone new when i even met anyone . this sounds pretty typical , and may not be a symptom of a mental health issue . you could just be an introvert . when i am with my friends and kidding with each other i am easily offended and sometimes i keep overthinking and feeling sad and depressed all the day i need help . this sounds like it could be anxiety , and maybe a lack of coping skills for handling disagreements or hearing criticisms it does not sound like your friends are criticizing you , but you take offense to friendly jokes . if you have access to a therapist i suggest you give therapy a try , but if you can not do therapy , perhaps look for a debt workbook which can help you develop skills to overcome overthinking things and being easily offended . x b <end>"
2494,<start> what does a sex therapist do <end>,"<start> it really depends . a lot of the time it is essentially marriage couples counseling that may or may not focus on sexual dysfunction one of the main causes of relationships failing is because of some type of sexual dysfunction , ie ed , vaginismus , etc . there are some clinicians who do specialize ex , bds community and work with specific and unique issues that are typically present in different relationship types . i am going to likely pursue getting that certification via aspect american association of sexuality educators , counselors , and therapists once i am done with my residency for licensure . the aspect website has a ton of info resources . also they have a yearly conference which is super interesting . <end>"
2495,<start> why does not losing people bother me <end>,"<start> death is fucking weird and absolutely can be something that may not affect you as powerfully as it does others . humans are vary so much in every aspect of our existences . death is absolutely a major part of living . if it does not affect you in your day to day life and create some sort of dysfunction for you , it may just be a situation that is what it is . maybe getting connected with a psychologist who could do some psychological testing if you wanted some concrete results regarding empathy , apathy , etc . could give you some more understanding . i personally do not think that is too bizarre maybe could even be used for some good down the line volunteer in a palliative care wing of a hospital , become a mortician , etc . there is a lot of professions that deal with death and dying that someone s got to do even talking to someone in those fields could be helpful for clarity . <end>"

2503,<start> at what point might a therapist begin getting annoyed at a client due to lack of progress <end>,"<start> the only way i become maybe a little frustrated is if it is been months and we are no further forward because the client will not engage and does not try , at that point i might say it probably is not the right time for them to be in therapy . that is not what it sounds like in your case , but is your therapist doing enough to help you do you have goals have you met some outcomes i . e . making sense of something previously not understood , finding positive coping skills it may just be that the hits keep coming and therapy is helping you cope with it , it is hard to see yourself moving forward when difficult situations keep arising . often there is progress but it is hard to see if small , has your therapist reflected on your progress do you have a good rapport <end>"

2505,<start> can you see a therapist specifically if your problem is struggling with committing to advice given by therapists <end>,"<start> i mean , probably i have had the same struggle but i am being much more honest with my new therapist this time around , and laying it all out there . including my tendency to ghost therapists . <end>"
2506,<start> i get resentful very quickly but i am not sure if it is a normal behavior <end>,"<start> as far as the personality disorder questions , i am going to say you do not fit any criteria based on what information you provided . you can have a negative or disordered trait symptom coping skill without it being a dam official disorder if that makes sense . <end>"
2507,<start> therapists encouraging bad behavior <end>,<start> i think it is important to remember that the therapist is working off of your roommates self report and you are hearing the outcomes through the roommate s perspective as well . is it possible that the behavior is being encouraged possibly . i think that if it feels appropriate you can explain how her anyone are influencing how you are feeling and express a desire for something different . and explaining that her anyone while helping her are damaging relationships around her <end>

2523,<start> what are some red flags when seeing a therapist <end>,"<start> a couple of things come to mind personally , i will not see any therapist who believes that most problems are simply due to a chemical imbalance in the brain . if they just want to give me pills for my chemical imbalance , i am out of there . that said , i suspect this is typically a problem with psychiatrists and not with counselors . perhaps the more extreme problems require medication , but i do not want to see any therapist who is quick to medicate . i have heard that some counselors are pride based where maybe they just give you a pep talk and they pump you up and tell them that all of your problems are not your fault . i personally try to avoid this . that said , the best thing to do is probably to read reviews online and to choose someone who has a lot of good reviews . lastly and you might not like this one but a lot of churches want to see people healed and they will often have relationships with local counselors . . . and i think they kind of know who the good ones are . so i suppose you could also find a local non denominational church that has good reviews and give them a phone call and see who they might recommend . you might even be able to ask them specific questions about the therapist if they have a good relationship with them . <end>"
2524,<start> giving receiving compliments <end>,"<start> i am guessing the question is what should i do say i think my answer to that would be too just keep being your genuine self . if he does not accept those compliments , that is a reflection of him and his thought process kind of how you pointed it out in yourself . now , if you are actually trying to challenge that belief of his , i would suggest just gently asking why he does not believe those things about himself . listen with genuine curiosity and ask questions as if you do not experience it yourself . i like to tell people that you do not need a degree to be a therapist , you just need empathy and listening skills . he may talk about it , or he may not respecting those boundaries and walls is just as important as listening . <end>"

2544,<start> parents want me to get a job at the same company as my ex . <end>,"<start> i am not a therapist , but in my opinion it would be better for you to just tell your parents you will not be working there and that your decision is final rather than trying to persuade them to validate your concerns . i think by validating your own feelings believing they are important and acting as such , you kind of put other people in a position to either agree your feelings are important or decide they do not care . if someone decides they do not care when feelings are honestly and compassionately expressed then i do not think there is anything you can do about that , you just have to accept they have their own issues and leave it at that . one way i have found helpful with people who lack empathy is to empathise with their position why do they behave coldly out of what intentions are they acting are they just struggling like the rest of us do not get me wrong , i am not suggesting you put their struggles above your own , but i have found personally that empathising with those who hurt me has made it easier for me to walk away without holding on to anger and continuing to let the situation hurt me . <end>"

2580,<start> how can i help my partner who feels unfulfilled in his job and has confessed to having suicidal thoughts . <end>,"<start> i have always dealt with constant low grade depression dysthymia , with some bouts of deeper depression peppered in there . twice , i had jobs i was very unhappy at i have never been suicidal , but unhappy to the point of calling my spouse or former bosses in tears and thought all would be solved by leaving that job . and it was . . . . . for a while . i have now been a homemaker for years this month and while i am very grateful every day for the ability to do this , i have had at least memorable bouts of heavy depression that came out of nowhere . his job may be a current factor affecting him , but his long term mental stability is still very fragile . no perfect job , or girlfriend , etc . is going to take the place of counseling for past issues or medication for a chemical imbalance . this is a fact , and for the sake of your own happiness and mental health , please consider the possibility that you may need to walk away to force him into a decision if he continues to refuse to seek help for himself . your life cannot be lived for someone else . i hope you are both able to find a solution . editing to add that i was in counseling for over two years and it has changed my life . i also regularly use a therapy light for s . a . d . chronic depression is a life ling condition and should be treated and maintained as such . <end>"

2590,<start> what kind of therapy should i get <end>,<start> i would advise to look for therapists as you will want one for marriage and for personal issues . because the marriage therapist should have both partners needs in mind when working with you . i would think a solution focused approach would help as you work to build your strengths . <end>

2595,<start> how do i stop worrying about my problems <end>,<start> which medication to try is probably a question best left to your prescribing provider . do you see a therapist they could help assess your efficacy to your current list of coping skills and help you improve on them or add better ones . <end>
2596,<start> confidentiality regarding weed <end>,"<start> the easiest and simplest answer is , no . weed or any illegal drug use does not warrant breaking confidentiality . it is a little more complicated because there could possibly be some situations in which use of the may warrant breaking confidentiality but this would be in threats or risk of harm to self or other . which i would say is extremely unlikely either weed . while the laws vary by state , yes , discuss it with your therapist some states even have drug use specifically protected so therapists cannot tell adult parents of a child s use without the child s consent . <end>"
2597,<start> are therapists required to break confidentiality over abuse that happened years ago i am a minor <end>,"<start> well , it depends a little bit on the definition of abuse in the state in which you live . some states define child abuse only as being possible from someone expected to protect them . however , in general , the answer would be yes , if you are a minor and been abused the therapist would be required to report this . it does not , however , have to be reported to your parent . but i would suggest generally that is probably a good idea . <end>"

2600,<start> advice on how to deal with my mental problems <end>,"<start> how old are you depending on that you may be old enough to consent for treatment on your own without your parents involvement . additionally you should be able to go to therapy and have confidentiality with the therapist . the therapist is ethically bound to not disclose what you tell them in session , with a few exceptions , so it should not get back to your parents . i think that doing therapy in person could help you with the feelings that you are having vs trying something online . <end>"

2602,"<start> regretting going for therapy in school , because now i feel exposed and scared <end>","<start> hi , counselor here . i work in a community mental health agency , so i do not have a ton of experience with particularly how school based mental health centers work . however , based on what i know from my own experience in college and interactions with school therapists as a professional , a lot of those centers exist solely for school related crisis type stuff . what i mean by this is that they specialize in stuff that can be resolved in those six or so sessions . if you are experiencing something more , it may be beneficial for you to link with an outpatient therapist in a clinic or a private practice . it also sounds like you may have discussed these fears without being able to really process them , which could be contributing to your concerns . it can be a little weird at first to trust someone so intimately in a session and then have no interaction outside of that , that is typically normal . however , it is normal for her to not talk to you outside of sessions . that is out of respect to your confidentiality , even moresco because she is the school therapist . basically , other people know who she is , so if she is seen talking in detail with someone , potentially others could infer the relationship . the way i explain this to my clients is that i do not know who they are with , and they do not know who i am with , so i do not want to say hi and put them in the awkward position of explaining who i am to their partner friend family , etc . also , i would not be able to explain to my husband family friend who they would be , and because my loved ones know my profession obviously , they would probably infer the relationship by me not telling them . tl dr , yes normal and usually for your benefit . i know it is strange to see therapists just existing , being people outside of their offices , but that is just it , we are people too . i am sure that she is not thinking about all of the things you disclosed every time she sees you out and about . i am sure that is difficult to really swallow and have it stick , but it is probably true . if i see a client outside of the office , more often than not my whole concern is just making the client feel comfortable . i am not outgoing by any means , but i always said hi to people i know while out and about before starting therapy work , so now it takes a little extra control not to do that when i see a client . so that is all i am thinking about . as far as recordings go , i would check the consent forms you would have signed when you started services , or talk with someone at the center about your rights to the recordings . you should have some sort of right to knowing what is going on with those at the least , depending on the laws where you are , but the forms usually lay this out . <end>"
2603,"<start> if your work health insurance is a group plan , will they see you are using your coverage for mental health visits <end>","<start> hip prohibits employers from accessing patient records or insurance claims because it could result in discrimination . if an employer wants to see any of your medical information , the employer would need to receive your written permission . under hip , your supervisor or human resource officials can request a doctor s note or information about your health only if needed to administer sick leave , workers compensation , wellness programs or health insurance . <end>"

3396,<start> stress rash <end>,"<start> just for the record , a friend used to get eczema rashes from stress . she was on lexapro believe for stress . she went to the doctor and the dude has a screaming fit with her mom over it since it reached some real bad levels , and she should have been brought in much earlier . after some tests , turned out it was from the lexapro being too high , she was already on pretty minimal doses . i have no idea how they came to this conclusion , i think it was more of let us try this and see if it decreases , in combination with some ointments . if you take any drugs , look to them as well . it simply could also be in your head . i was on vacation with my family a week ago and developed stress hives . since i have been back home i do not live with them , my mood has improved significantly and i feel amazing i have not gotten any new hives and the ones i have are tapering out . so if you are in a stressful situation like school or in a bad place , see if you can relocate yourself or remove yourself from the trigger for some time so you can get better . if it is strictly stress , i can not just tell you to be happy , that is not how it works . surround yourself with friends and do things you love , even if it is hard to do either of those things . as for the panic attacks , i may recommend an inhauler . a doc can prescribe it and they are otc . the adrenaline may because more harm than good but if your throat is closing , you need air . i usually wagger what is worse in each situation with the understanding that it will not be fun . panic attacks and stress are actually a trigger of asthma , did not realize i was asthmatic for most of my life until i talked to my doc . i also suggest a second opinion about this , some docs i have noticed are not open to possibilities . i am sorry your having trouble , i hope you feel better soon <end>"

3453,<start> so is uncontrollable job stress <end>,"<start> i find your thoughts about resigning irrational so i will address that first . you can resign . if it is in your contract and there is a set notice period , you are not legally bound to stay and the worst that can happen is people will be upset with you . yes they will be pretty much fucked . who knows how much money and clients they will lose . but it is not really your problem and it is their fault for not having enough hands on deck and redundancy in place . do you own or manage the business no . then it is not your responsibility to make sure it is successful if someone resigns . even if you resigning causes the collapse of the entire business and bankruptcy it is really not your problem and there is honestly nothing they can come at you for if you followed the conditions of your contract . as far as your deadlines go do some estimates for how long it is going to take , without working too much extra hours . if you are not going to make it then you need to renegotiate the deadline . if this company is not willing to move deadlines based on the time a project will take , then they are honestly not worth working for . good project management is done in one of two ways . figuring out how long something will take and then setting the deadline . . if deadline is immovable , remove work such that a minimal working product or working but incomplete product can be delivered by the deadline . if they never move deadlines and never remove or simplify work , then you have an incompetent project manager and you deserve to work for someone with a better aptitude for good project and risk management . <end>"

3455,<start> how do i recover my creativity after stress <end>,"<start> allow . do not force anything . allow the energy of creation to flow through you . you are pure creative energy , after all . reconnect with those parts of you that you have neglected to see , feel and heal . feel how appreciative you are that you are even in the position where being creative is a desire within you . that is a huge manifestation of creative energy in its own right . write this above your work space , great creator , i will take care of the quantity , you take care of the quality . every morning when you wake up write pages stream of consciousness . do not consider it real writing . just do not let the pen leave the page for consecutive pages , even if you end up writing , ah i do not know what to write . i am so blocked these days . why can not i just focus on my creative passions what is it that i am not allowing to come up to be released so that the whole universe can flow through me and create . every day , write those pages , no matter what . it just becomes a part of you . learn to trust your inner voice . allow your inner critic to have his judgements and criticisms but do not believe them . just let them be without giving your belief to them . <end>"

3462,<start> noise pollution over sensitivity <end>,"<start> i get sensory overload too multiple times per day . foi this is a very long post , but i wrote i am some strategies to cope with oversensitivity . hopefully you will read all of this and find something helpful out of it . i have headphones that are pretty much noise canceling that help me a lot . i go to a quiet place , put them in i do not play any music or anything i just put them in to block out noise , ear plugs would work too . , turn off the lights and just lay there while doing deep breathing . i stay in that place as long as i need to . also , try to keep track of anything that seems to trigger you . try keeping notes i like to use the google keep app of the date , time , and what you were doing when you reach your threshold . do this for a few weeks to a month , or as long as you want . it will help you identify patterns of times and situations where you tend to reach that threshold and then you can come up with some modifications . for example , i get really overstimulated at the grocery store so now my husband goes . i get overstimulated at work when it is loud from everyone talking and the phones constantly ringing , so i always keep my headphones in my pocket and i will skip away to the bathroom to get a few minutes of quiet time . another thing i like to do is go for a walk in the park and get a dose of nature , it always makes me feel better . i also like kayaking , it gives me a nice dose of tranquility . nothing is wrong with you , we live in a world now where there is so much noise , so many distractions . oversensitivity to stimuli is a real thing , some people are just wired differently if you google it you should be able to find information on it . self care is important , so schedule a block of time every day for sensory deprivation . this means turning off your cellphone , blocking out noise , and light . also , i obviously do not know your past but people who have been through traumatic events in their life such as a traumatic brain injury , physical emotional sexual abuse , military veterans who deployed to war zones , have asperger s or autism , all of these people are much more likely to experience sensory overload . i have a nephew who has autism and when he gets overstimulated , his parents use some of the strategies i mentioned earlier in this post . it is important to find safe people to talk to about what you are going through and avoid sharing your struggles with those who are criticizing the way you feel . give yourself permission to have these feelings , because they are legitimate the more you accept and acknowledge your feelings , the better you will start to feel i really hope my advice helps you , because i know how distressing sensory hypersensitivity can feel . <end>"

3534,<start> i feel overwhelmed <end>,"<start> not eating and not sleeping well are going to because you to become even more fatigued . if you do not have time or are too stressed to sit down and eat , buy some yogurt , protein bars , or other handheld snacks for quick bites . try taking deep breaths . on the bright side , you only have one month left before you can be free . you should write down everything you have to do and then rank them by priorities . only focus on one thing at a time to maximize your ability to handle each task well so you do not think about everything at once . it sounds like the foreign language test is very urgent , so i would rank that either at the top or near the top . when you do get the chance , try to either take naps or do something fun , so you can regain some of your energy . i know it is hard to relax when you have so much on your plate , but it seems like you need it . with so little time left , i think you should not worry about anyone else , not your friends and not your classmates how they do and what they do should not really affect your own performance , and like you realized , comparing yourself to them just makes you feel bad . just focus on yourself and how you can make it through the month . <end>"

3542,<start> i am the liability for the company <end>,"<start> ever thought about getting into the reselling business like with bay and talebook marketplace if you do it well enough and try hard enough , you can get to a place where you can just buy cheap and sell high , anything you can get your hands on , from yard sales to estate sales and so on , and make enough money to survive off just that . it is way better than a normal job , way more fun , no boss , you get to see all the cool stuff humanity has come up with as it passes through your hands and turns into money . the best part is the harder you work it , the more you make , unlike a regular job . it takes time to make it profitable . you have to pour all of your profit right back into the business to keep growing it , but eventually it pays off when you can sustain yourself with the proceeds . just a thought for you . it is what i am trying to do to break out of the because i hate it so bad . if you are interested , i recommend heading over to couture and binge watching the resale killers , craigslist hunter and garage flips to get you started . look up the basics about buying and selling on bay , because you will be doing most of your business through bay and amazon . bay is the one you want to start with though . it is hard work , but not necessarily physically hard , just lots of dedication to learning what sells for what , and you have to pour all of your free time allllll of it into it to have a chance at making it successful . either way , good luck <end>"

3570,<start> what i have been going through lately <end>,"<start> hard times shape strong people . and if you can get through times where it seems like everything is falling apart , you can get through anything . life gives us seasons which means that it is not always going to be like this . cutting yourself will only make this season of your life that more difficult . x b about your paper , go and talk to your psychology teacher . if he she can do anything , it will be to help you and for your benefit only . tell him her what is going on at home . any decent person would only want to help . maybe he she could talk to you about self harm as well . x b about your dog , comfort her and pet her and play with her . you will feel a lot better , too . dogs are great emotional support animals , but they need support and love just as much as we do . x b if anything , try to look at the move as a positive thing . you are getting out of a really bad house and a lucky landlord . that is awesome news it can seem like a bad thing because you are watching your parents struggle , but please understand that they might be going through a bad season , too . i watched my father fall into a depression for months when he lost his previous job . he felt like a failure for not being able to provide for his family . so my sister and i got jobs and were able to help out as much as we could . that was years ago and this past christmas my father opened up to me how our strength and resilience and determination during that time helped him see the brighter side . x b when i was in high school , i did not understand the power i could have had by asking for help . as an adult , i realized that sometimes asking for help is necessary in anything that you do . but , more importantly , asking others if they need help is big . by lightening other s load , you are sure to feel happier and may even find your load is lighter , too . i wish you the best of luck do not harm yourself , believe me , it is not worth it nor is it doing anything to change the situation that you are in . people care and there is someone me on reedit thinking of you and confident that you can get through this <end>"

3579,<start> i do not know how to be a college student <end>,"<start> i can relate in that the past few months i have been stressing to the point of anxiety due to university . what you really need to do is talk to someone . i cannot stress this enough . contact your personal tutor as soon as possible this is a tutor you go to for support i assume colleges in the us also have this . they are someone to talk to , will support you and point you in the right direction in terms of your wellbeing , student life etc . get help from your class teachers . ask them about where you are going wrong . from your post you seem intelligent and hardworking and i honestly think you will get very far with just a few little tweaks and the guidance of your teachers . you just need to ask as they are the experts . similarly befriend any older students a year above you doing your course they may give you helpful advice . when you are feeling really down in the evenings night line can help you out a lot . you need to vent , letting it all out is healthy . also consider using a counselling service if your college has one please do not be too harsh on yourself . remember the good in your life , see hardships as obstacles that you will overcome . you seem really hard working , and you have your priorities right which is great . hopefully once you have spoken to your teachers for advice you will become better at your work and this will open up free time . pursue a hobby exercise clubs for your mental well being . getting enough sleep is also very important for your mood and exam performance hang in there man especially if you find your course interesting , when times are tough there will always be light at the end . and you will have learnt more about yourself <end>"

3581,"<start> i do not get time to relax anymore and i can barely take it . grades are going down , i can not stay awake anywhere , i do not enjoy anything anymore , i just do not know what to do . <end>","<start> i lived through that situation , i have no idea how i got through high school . i dropped out from university because it was way worse . x b years after that i visited a psychiatrist and realized why keeping up with everything was so hard , i had been living my whole life with add my whole life . i started medication , stress reduced practically to zero because everything was so easy . i am a year away from graduating even if i am way older , but thanks to realizing that my life got way better . x b your school must have counselors , visit them . they can guide you . maybe your problems are easier to fix than mine , maybe they are worse . but by what you are telling us , it seems its something related to time scheduling or attention span . <end>"
3582,<start> wish i knew it is okay to speak up <end>,"<start> that is a great video but i am not sure about it is utility . like i get the goal , decrease stigma , but that does seem to be happening already . and there are universities that are addressing this issue , not all of them of course , but mine is for example . even still , as someone with mental health issues i think a more useful message would be how one actually utilizes resources that are available to them . because like the video says it is hard to talk about these problems due to their innate nature , and so maybe a guide suggesting how one contacts a mental health professional let us say on campus could be more useful and more direct . maybe talk about confidentiality and stuff . it would be great if society talked about physical and mental health equally but what about the people suffering right now . <end>"

3584,<start> i do not like spending time with my mother <end>,"<start> it is super hard . but what if you just focused on being kind and grateful around her . gratitude in the sense of she has put a roof over your head and is trying to take you on a vacation , even if that is all the good you can think of . kindness in that she is just trying her best even if it does not seem like it . there is goodness in everyone , sometimes you just have to look harder for it . perhaps take a journal and use it to write out some of your feelings . it can be a nice release . <end>"
3585,<start> getting burnt out . . . i do not know what to do . i am currently in university and struggling to keep up . <end>,<start> walk or sit outside . dance to a good song . prioritize homework and studying weekly by making a list . that way once it is checked off you can be done for the day . i found school led me to feel never caught up or like i should always be doing something but if i had a daily schedule for tasks then i could check them off and feel off work <end>

3588,<start> can stress because throbbing headaches on one side of the head and pain tightness on one side of the neck <end>,"<start> i get left brain headaches like this from stress . taking paracetamol or aleve helps . it just gives you some relief until it wears off . so i only take it once or twice a day . neck and shoulder pain from stress is very common as well . you definitely need to get a massage or do some exercises to help you . a lot of people hold their stress in the shoulders and then this creates neck muscle pain and consequently headaches . i say it feels like a hot poker in my left temple . it eventually does go away . however , you do have to do some work and figure out what helps you relax . . . meditate . yoga . herbal tea . stretching exercises . massage . removing yourself from the stress factor . bow , an aside , allergies can because sinus issues which can because headaches too . worth checking out . if you have a headache , you get stressed , and get shoulder and neck pain too . i have had both scenarios . but more likely it is just good old shitty stress . hope you feel better soon . ps . also , grinding your teeth at night if you do this , get a night guard it can because weird headaches and stress in your neck . <end>"

3590,<start> what to do when you feel like your brain is broken from stress <end>,"<start> what i try to do is to simplify the stress . it might sound crazy , but if you are overthinking or freaking out then trying to simplify the stress can help calm the brain . i try to do that when i have a huge stress on me and then i go to sleep . i wake up in the morning ready to tackle the problem . i hope this helps . . . <end>"

3602,<start> i am worried i am losing touch with reality <end>,"<start> if you feel like you are at risk of worsening your mental health , absolutely talk to someone . if not your parents , then a professional or someone who can recommend one . just another attention seeking teenager is a stereotype , and is dismissive . these are real things that you are experiencing , and nobody especially you should have to suffer because of lack of understanding or unwillingness to help , especially if you know that it runs in your family . stay strong , friend . <end>"
3603,<start> why am i doing this <end>,"<start> hey i know exactly how you feel because i used to be the same way in high school , especially my last two years . i am also a freshman in college and i can say that i have really come a long way i do not want to sound insensitive at all , but what i want to tell you is that better days are ahead of you . they are coming and will always be there . life is not always the same . i know you feel this way right now and so did i . but then i came to college and my life has drastically changed over a year . your feelings are valid , but never think poorly of yourself . there is nothing wrong in staying by yourself . i know that it always seems like people who are out there living their lives are the happiest ones , but trust me , deep inside everyone is fighting their own struggles . this is not to compare yours to anyone else s but i just wanted to point out that everyone has those days and moments . keep your head up and realize that you are more than enough . it was not until coming to college when i realized that i have so much to offer to people around me and that i had all this hidden potential that i never thought i had back in high school . i know your journey is different from mine , but regardless you have your own unique qualities that no one else does . i hope that you do come across opportunities in college where you will realize in small bits how special you are in your way . i know i am an internet stranger , but feel free to message me i genuinely hope the best for you . remember that you are special and have a lot to offer to the world you live in . <end>"

3610,<start> messed up at work and do not know how to tell my boss <end>,"<start> i find it helps to just look at the situation objectively , and ask questions can this be easily corrected can you correct it on your own if it can not be corrected , what is the impact it does not sound like this will have any negative impact . tell your boss what happened , explain the system froze and therefore the error . if your boss cannot accept that then quite frankly they are not worth working for i work in a rather intense environment and make silly mistakes all the time , but i attempt to fix them as soon as possible and inform others who may be impacted by it and then move on . we are not robots . the key thing is how you can resolve a forced or unforced error . do not beat yourself up . this varies from place to place , but if you are worried for your job over a couple silly errors then honestly that place sounds toxic . the people i respect most in my workplace are those who fuck up and then own up to it and immediately go about fixing it , it is something i value in a colleague more than anything else . do not run to the bosses with every error , you need to judge the importance of an error on your own terms and whether it needs reporting . this is also important for your overall career growth . <end>"

3612,<start> can stress because a tight uncomfortable feeling in one side of the neck <end>,"<start> yes , big time . stress can because a ton of physical problems , and i hold all my stress in my shoulders and neck . i highly suggest finding a thai massage place and spending the money on one . they will work that out of you , no problem . <end>"

3617,<start> overwhelmed by stress choosing new career path <end>,"<start> well , your next move does not have to be a job you are going to do for the rest of your life . but i would recommend finding something that gives you a decent raise or at least has a clear path . try looking for something like plumbing . there are shops that are hiring entry level people and only ask that you have a driver s license . after about months i am sure that you will find you have a bit more financial freedom to go after something else if you want . lots of shops will even pay for you to get certifications after you get some experience . <end>"
3618,<start> overwhelmed and it is causing chest pressure . <end>,<start> get away from the situation right away go sit down and take deep breaths i have had to do this just walking away from a stressful situation helps however if you can get away for a few days or even meditation might help i know i could use a vacation but i am broke i hope you feel better <end>
3619,<start> can anxiety stress because these types of memory issues <end>,"<start> being in an abusive relationship , and dealing with stress of unimaginable levels , along with stress induced insomnia . . . i have gotten so much brain fog i have to say hum ever rd word , life will also feel like a haze . i used to always be drained no matter how much sleep i got . stress reduction is so hard to master . i currently got a better job , i walk about away from situations where people are obviously over exaggerating yelling about certain things . i try to always keep my cool . i use to be a very angry teenager , but these days i am exactly the opposite . i am as level headed as can be . one thing i can not stress enough for my case least is always carry your sence of dignity . when i feel like i am less than , or am being made to feel as such , i assert my dignity . i try to always live like i am sure of myself . when i am not and still am very often i ask myself what feels right , and what feels like an obligation these things are not mutually exclusive , but when they are doing what you feel is right for you is the better choice . getting the new job i got , that is not physically mentally demanding , something i enjoy , a place to be free from the world . it fits me . find something that fits you . do not sit and wait for change . strive for it . i came from an abusive neglecting home , and until i was able to get out i was constantly stressed . i am in a pretty bad point in my relationship , but feeling in control more has helped me a lot . good luck man pm me with questions , i will be happy to answer . or just to talk . i feel like i have a long way to go in stress reduction , but i have came so much further than i ever thought i would . i can say even in my struggles . i am happy . <end>"
3620,<start> i just walk away from everything <end>,<start> i have experienced some similar issues when i was in college . i would just put my books in front of me while binge watching series . when the stress level closer to the deadline was at its highest i would start studying . what helped for me is not putting too much pressure on myself and setting small goals . for example i will study one or two chapters before noon and then i will have a nice lunch and take a long break . when this is done i re evaluate . it really helps taking the weight of your shoulders doing one part instead of worrying about the entire course . believe in yourself you can do it goeduck <end>
3621,<start> i can not handle all this alone <end>,"<start> listen , there are online websites that pay you for giving them articles . maybe you could check out some of that as it is rather time flexible . i know that buzzed at least has this feature . many newspapers also accept new articles and pay a decent sum if you are trying to get by at least where i am from . other than that , you can do menial clerical jobs for people alongside . things like babysitting or working at some local store , a pet centre or something along the lines . i am sure if you look around , it would lead somewhere . maybe go through some of the stuff you own and sell it off for some quick cash . you can stay with your aunt and manage your finances from the food perspective . just not having to pay rent could make a huge difference from what i understand . also , you will not have a starter fee to deal with . even a friend s house works in that respect . for your anxiety and depression , i know that some nos give free mental health help . check to see if there are any in your area or you can have telephonic sessions or something . it is important that you take care of this and do not bottle it up so give it due consideration . talking about it helps more often than not . lastly , you got to keep your head up . all of this shall pass someday . i know it is hard but it is going to be fine . <end>"
3622,<start> things i wish i knew <end>,"<start> do not even try to do all your readings . i do not agree with this , but maybe it depends on your major . math for example might assign chapters , and often you learn by doing more than by reading , so you can skim over the chapters and do the practice questions instead . my minor had a lot of readings , but i set a schedule and made it through them . there were a lot of details on tests that i would not have gotten from chapter summaries , but that i remembered because i did the readings , and doing so definitely helped my grades . again though it probably depends on the major and the context , maybe the author is right in some cases . <end>"

3635,<start> i need some tips on reliving stress <end>,"<start> mental fatigue can have a huge impact on your productivity . if you are like me , thinking about everything , especially negative thoughts can exhaust your brain , leaving you feeling physically exhausted . when this happens to me , and trust me , i have done some fucked up shit causing some sort of post traumatic episodes mixed in with guilt and anxiety . the best thing for me is cognitive behavioral change . instead of the bad stuff , i try to focus on the wonderful good in my life and how i was given a second chance . try to not focus on any thoughts , meditate if you can get into the zone . go outside and feel the breeze and look at the wonderful nature outside walk around and enjoy yourself . a nice shower , a candle , relaxing music anything to give yourself and your brain to settle obsessive thoughts . focus on what you can control , not stuff that is out of your hands or situations you cannot go back and change . make a list , add small stuff first such as , showering or brushing your teeth . check off your list and get into the motion of being productive in a small way . the best thing for me is a clean house , bedroom and bathroom . i enjoy cooking and listening to music while my candle is lit i am a guy . do not be too hard on yourself . do not overthink . take one step at a time . and just remember , everything will be okay . good luck and hang in there <end>"
3636,<start> how do i manage to keep up with my tight schedule and not break down <end>,"<start> take a breath . write down everything you need to do in the next however many weeks . then , write out a schedule for how you will approach these things . right now these are your priority . other things may come up but you need to decide if they are more important . take that list and schedule your studying out daily . then take things one at a time . reward yourself with a min break for completing things . also , study for min , break for , and do that rotation times then take a longer min break . this is a more effective way to study . that minute break is important so force yourself to stop after min for a break . finally , take a breath again . in a month you are going to be so much more stress free and think hell yeah i did that . i have been in those situations and they suck in the moment but i can not tell you how many of these i have gotten through and now i am at a point that i recognize it will pass . you will not fail out . in fact you seem extremely motivated and smart and you are going to do great things . it all pays off . so again , take a breath , make a list , and get to it . reward yourself and recognize the progress you have made . you got this edit also , if necessary , explain your situation to teachers and ask for an extension . even if they say no , they recognize that you care . <end>"
3637,<start> tough project almost broke me . do not know where to go from here <end>,"<start> first of all , congratulations on finishing it well done how would you treat yourself for this achievement what will be the best reward week of sleep holiday if you are looking for immediate relief . . . maybe guided meditation , a long shower or a bath could help or any type of physical activity i . e . swimming , jogging or even jumping on the same spot calming tea or a glass of wine not really healthy though might do the job too . <end>"
3638,<start> how do i control my temper and stress <end>,"<start> well that depends on how specifically your temper emerges . do you take a lot of things personally do you internalize your anger and let it stack and stack until you explode like a ticking time bomb , or explode snap at other people often , even for minor things <end>"
3639,"<start> well that depends on how specifically your temper emerges . do you take a lot of things personally do you internalize your anger and let it stack and stack until you explode like a ticking time bomb , or explode snap at other people often , even for minor things <end>",<start> all of them <end>
3640,<start> all of them <end>,"<start> well it sounds like you should work with an anger management professional in person and people on reedit can not help you as much as a professional you see regularly . that will be by far , your most effective strategy . however , i do have a couple suggestions to help you get started . first off , i strongly recommend you try meditating twice per day for minute sessions . once in the morning , once in the evening . do that for a month straight , and see how you feel . then , continue it for another month . and another . it will not completely fix your anger problems of course , but it will help rewire your brain to be less susceptible to stress , and it will also reduce your risk of heart disease and provide some much needed mental relaxation . it also helps to get a meditation partner , if you can . that way , you guys can hold each other accountable and make it a daily habit . if you are new to meditation , try this . http www . mindful . org how to meditate as far as snapping at people , i would recommend to catch yourself before an outburst , internally acknowledge your anger , and then instead , dig deeper into what the person is saying , and why they are saying it . too often , people s intentions get misconstrued as offensive , when that is not how they meant it . maybe the person was simply trying to provide feedback to help you improve , or making some playful comment they did not realize was offensive to you . i would recommend next time you find yourself in that situation , notice the anger , and acknowledge it . in nap , they even recommend giving it a color , texture and name ie , red , coarse , outburst or magenta , foggy , rage . if you need to remove yourself for a few minutes , do so . but always try to see the message behind what the person is saying , instead of seeing it as an attack . make them feel acknowledged by saying something along the lines of that is a valid point . can you tell me more always seek to understand the other person s point of view without judging yourself , them or the situation . chances are , no one is actually trying to upset you , so it is good to see the situation as objectively as possible and realize they are trying to address an issue or somehow communicate to you , not personally attack you . <end>"
3641,<start> stressing over the future <end>,"<start> well if it makes you feel any better , i was not the best student in school . i went to community college , had no direction in life , and eventually got my bachelors degree . i now work in a field where i am going to make six figures in a few years , and i am building myself as an entrepreneur . no one has their life figured out at even the people who think they do . but that is the beauty of life you try something , then adjust , then try something new , then adjust , etc . only about of people stay in careers which they studied for in college . and most jobs care way less about your gap and college major than you may realize . just show up and be your best self every day . that is it . i am turning this april , and that is by far the most valuable lesson i learned over the past decade . i also believe society has it backwards you can not be expected to figure your life out when you are . my advice is that you can go to community college . or volunteer abroad at the peace corps . or join the armed services , who will both give you tons of life experience , living abroad experience and pay for your college looking back , i actually wish i considered joining an armed services branch at for those reasons . then , enroll in college at , or hell , even . there is far less of a rush to attend college than you may realize i speak from firsthand experience . trust me , things may not seem this way right now . but they are better than you realize p . s . gary vaynerchuck , arnold schwartenegger and richard brandon were also not very good students . the first two went to average universities no one heard of , and richard did not go to college at all . one of them is an insanely famous actor , and the other two are multi billionaires . if you need anything else , message me <end>"

3745,<start> hobby stress <end>,"<start> i have the exact same issue . my hobbies stress me out like crazy , if i do not spend my time on a hobby i deem as productive way of spending time , i also feel terrible about myself is netflix , browsing the internet i enjoy my hobbies i feel great doing them but i get stressed about trying to do them . that stress causes me to go for mind numbing options . for me it has two causes , i start becoming too perfectionistic and i have anxiety regarding it . framing them as something that needs to be done regularly , forcing it too much , trying too hard to keep a schedule all leads to stress and not doing any of it . i do not have a solution yet , and i am still working on it . but it is the stress that is the main killer , leading me to self destructive behavior . i try to make a conscious effort to change the way i think . remind myself how i feel when doing my hobbies , how it is giving me joy doing them etc . also setting the bar lower . if i plan to play the piano everyday i get stressed and then do not do it at all . so alternative is , at least minutes , make a conscious effort to think about the positive feeling i have doing it . or let us say times a week , if i still feel stressed , then even less . time a week etc . setting the bar lower and lower helps but seriously having that as the main goal , not secretly hoping for more that makes it easy to feel good since everything planned got done and helps rebuilding a positive relationship tythe hobbies . i still have not quite managed though , because i keep slipping back into the all or nothing thinking . old habits die hard , i guess it takes effort and work but at some point it will come with ease keep trying . and catch yourself beating yourself up for not doing th productive and reframe it . also reframe the should into wants etc <end>"

3767,<start> overcoming housewife trauma <end>,"<start> i think there is a slow internal process for healing that , which is likely found in therapy . but i also think that establishing some external relationship with fire would actually be therapeutic , i . e . if you taught yourself how to extinguish a fire and even go camping and make a bonfire so you start to create positive connotations to it . find a way to make fire a neutral thing once again , and eventually in time even enjoyable . <end>"

3770,<start> how do you let go <end>,"<start> some things i feel sure of mentioning are that it is important to celebrate your accomplishments , even if they are far from your ultimate goals , and not let yourself undermine them . it is awesome that you have paid off that much debt and you should feel proud knowing that you have been a positive force in your kids life . i tend to let the bad overwhelm the good , but subtle choices to not beat yourself down might help alleviate your stress . i am not saying to start lying to yourself , but there is a happy medium between being realistic and being delusional . categorize what you can and can not control and try to release what you can not . every day that you go to work , no matter how crappy , take comfort in the fact that you are using something you can control to change your circumstance , even if it is not quickly . i do not know how realistic it is for you , but maybe consider looking for another job . you will not know if there is something better out there unless you try . if that seems too scary stressful then give yourself more credit . while the transition might be rough , bettering your circumstances would probably do wonders for other aspects of your life . even with your life being slammed , i hope you have some outlet to take care of yourself and do something you enjoy . whether that is physical exercise , some spiritual practice , reading , podcast , music , baths , movies , a clean living space , whatever works . in the interest of preventing burnout and being the best mom employee you can be , take care of yourself . ink , i hope some of this is helpful . motivational rant over . i wish you the best and i hope venting a little helped . <end>"

3779,<start> can i get some advice pus <end>,"<start> hey man . i am in first year uni uk and it is awesome whenever i see a levels mentioned on reedit takes me back to last year d . when you are smart it does feel like the school has some expectations on you , and that might be true because they want students going imperial , oxbridge etc . . . but your school will be happy for you wherever you go and whatever grades you get . it is up to you to not care about what your school wants and instead focus on yourself . in reality other students are focusing on themselves and your teachers do not have high expectations they just believe in you if that makes sense . what i am saying is that it is best if you avoid thinking that other people expect you to achieve it . only your opinion and expectations matter because in university there is a shift from your school caring being the centre of attention to no one caring about you . and imo that is much better . <end>"

3781,"<start> college is the best , but mostly the worst , thing that is ever happened to me <end>","<start> sorry if there are any typos my h key only works half of the time . x b i took two semesters off of college because of stress related sickness they were not back to back either . do not be afraid to take a break and just work for a semester or two to refocus and clear your head . what helped me a lot was not taking a butt load of classes all at once . i took the minimum number of credit hours required to be a full time student during my junior and senior year and took the rest of the required classes during the summer sure , the classes are more expensive , but you can take most core classes during the summer at a community college for less cost . you get less of a break , but it helped me stay in a school mindset while not being overwhelmed by assignments . i was still able to graduate on time doing this , but even if it takes you a semester or two longer than normal , its okay . everyone finishes at their own pace . also , try to take hard classes wit easy classes if you can . i purposely left some typical freshman courses for my senior year so that i had a class or two that i would not have to put as much effort into for me , these were stuff like sociology , psych , etc . x b i also suggest talking to a therapist regularly and for your case , i would also talk to a psychiatrist . i also had suicidal thoughts at some points , and being able to talk to someone helped keep me somewhat level headed . most universities offer therapy for free low cost . x b make sure you take time to eat right , exercise , and sleep right . its very basic sounding , but it makes a huge difference , and its crazy how the majority of people do not make these a priority . both my physical and mental problems did not start to improve until i worked on these even with depression medicine . also try to make time to relax even if its just an hour a day , or a night a week to hang out with friends . it is easy to think you are so busy that you have no time to relax , but that is a sure fire way to burn out . x b bottom line do not try to force yourself to work harder than is possible for you . give yourself more time if you need to , take time off if you need to . obviously , do something if you do take time off work , pick up a hobby , etc , but do not be afraid that you are failing in life if you do not go as fast as you think you should . and do not compare yourself to other people , because everyone has different circumstances . <end>"

3784,<start> cigarettes <end>,"<start> i started with just one cigarette . now i have been smoking for the past years . i am kind a obsessed with my teeth and currently going through a strange situation , where i am kind a stress free and looking for ways to create stress for myself . now i am like , if i am going to freak out about my teeth , i better quit smoking . i hopefully had my last cigarette like hour ago . why i wrote those things it never stays as cigarette . you always tell yourself like oh i can quit any time , but you can not . i tried several times , quit for a few months then started again , because of the temporary relief . x b when you are stressed , just as suggested try to find something else or think about the main reason why you are so stressed . it is not a good habit . i do not care about the economic part , but health is the main reason why you should not start . x b to relieve stress , i would suggest , do not limit yourself . meaning , if there is something that you want to do , that will not harm you or others of course , do that . try new things . the thing about nicotine is that it helps brain to stimulate dopamine and then you get addicted to it . the more you smoke , the more addicted you are to it , but dopamine levels get less and less . in the end , you smoke a pack a day to get the same satisfaction . instead , try something else that would excite you . anything is better compared to cigarettes , believe me . <end>"
3785,<start> i look to stress myself <end>,"<start> stress plays a really interesting role in the body . when you experience stress your brain releases chemicals into your bloodstream . over time your body develops a homeostasis , or norm with those chemicals . if you experience a change in your stress level your body almost craves those hormones and chemicals since it is so used to it being present . i am guessing your mind is creating ways for you to experience the stress and if your teeth are producing the effect it is looking for you have created a cycle . i hope that helps you better understand what is going on . <end>"

3788,<start> hi all . i am a y o waiter kitchenward that has been working non stop hour shifts most days at my understerstaffed restaurant for the last weeks . <end>,"<start> i have worked at restaurants over years . different types and with different positions . i can tell you , there was not one job that was not stressful . it made me hate working in restaurants and i have not for years and plan to never do it again . restaurants are tough work . i even ended up walking out of more than one of those jobs . people do not understand how much work a restaurant takes until they try it . my advice would be to hang on as long as you can , but if it is affecting your life in a seriously negative way you should try to find a different line of work . <end>"
